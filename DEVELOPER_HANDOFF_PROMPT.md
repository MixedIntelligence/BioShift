# 🚀 BioMVP Platform - Developer Handoff Prompt

**Current State:** RBAC Fixed & Platform Functional  
**Date:** July 5, 2025  
**Branch:** `BioShiftv9`  
**Commit:** `14dfbd7`

## 📋 Quick Start Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Chad-Main\Desktop\BioMVP\v9"
git checkout BioShiftv9
git pull origin BioShiftv9
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Servers
```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Backend
npm run start:backend

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
npm run start:frontend
```

### 3. Access the Platform
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API:** http://localhost:8080
- **Test Login:** `lab69@lab69.com` / `lab69@lab69.com`

## ✅ What's Working (Recently Fixed)

### Critical RBAC Bug Fixed
**Issue:** Role comparisons were case-mismatched, breaking all role-based features
- ✅ **Fixed:** All frontend role checks now use correct capitalized format ('Lab', 'Worker', 'Provider', 'Admin')
- ✅ **Result:** Navigation, buttons, and access control now work correctly for all user types

### Functional Features
- ✅ Authentication system (login/register/logout)
- ✅ Role-based navigation and UI elements
- ✅ Gig listing, posting, and viewing
- ✅ Offerings browsing and management
- ✅ Profile management
- ✅ Database operations and user management

### Platform Stability
- ✅ Removed RoleSwitcher component (was causing infinite loops)
- ✅ Fixed token validation and management
- ✅ Improved error handling in auth flow
- ✅ Hot-reload and proxy configuration working

## 🎯 Next Development Priorities

### 🔥 High Priority (Ready to Implement)
1. **Gig Application Workflow**
   - Worker applies to gig → Lab reviews applications → Accept/Reject flow
   - Application status tracking and notifications
   - Applicant management interface for Labs

2. **Enhanced Gig Management**
   - Lab users: edit/delete posted gigs
   - Gig status management (Open/In Progress/Completed)
   - Bulk applicant management

3. **Offerings Marketplace Workflow**
   - Provider posting and editing offerings
   - Lab/Worker inquiry and response system
   - Provider-Lab connection and collaboration tools

### 🚀 Medium Priority
4. **Real-time Features**
   - In-app chat between Labs and Workers
   - Real-time notifications for status changes
   - Live updates for gig applications

5. **Advanced Search & Filtering**
   - Skills-based gig matching algorithm
   - Location and salary range filtering
   - Saved searches and alerts

6. **Payment Integration**
   - Stripe/PayPal integration
   - Milestone-based payment system
   - Payment dispute resolution

└── models/gig.js                      # Gig database operations
```

### Database Schema (SQLite)
- **users** - User accounts with roles ('Lab', 'Worker', 'Provider', 'Admin')
- **gigs** - Job postings with status, requirements, compensation
- **applications** - Worker applications to gigs
- **offerings** - Provider service offerings

### Authentication Flow
- JWT tokens for session management
- Role-based access control throughout frontend/backend
- Secure password hashing and validation

## 🐛 Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
- SASS deprecation warnings (cosmetic)
- Hot-reload proxy errors for non-API requests
- Babel configuration warning in SuggestedPage

### Areas for Improvement
- Error handling could be more user-friendly
- Loading states and spinners need improvement
- Some UI components need responsive design work
- Test coverage needs to be added

## 💡 Development Guidelines

### Role-Based Development
Always use capitalized role format:
```javascript
// ✅ Correct
if (currentUser?.role === 'Lab') {
  // Lab-specific logic
}

// ❌ Incorrect (will break)
if (currentUser?.role === 'lab') {
  // This won't work
}
```

### Database Operations
Use the existing models for consistency:
```javascript
const user = await userModel.findUserById(userId);
const gigs = await gigModel.getAllGigs();
```

### Testing Role Changes
Debug role-based features in browser console:
```javascript
// Check current user state
store.getState().auth.currentUser
```

## 📞 Quick Reference Commands

### Development Commands
```powershell
# Check server status
netstat -ano | Select-String ":3000"
netstat -ano | Select-String ":8080"

# Database queries
cd backend
node -e "const db = require('./models/db'); console.log(db.prepare('SELECT * FROM users').all()); db.close();"

# Git workflow
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
git push origin BioShiftv9
```

### Testing Credentials
Check `SEED_CREDENTIALS.md` or use:
- **Lab:** `lab69@lab69.com` / `lab69@lab69.com`
- **Worker:** `worker69@worker69.com` / `worker69@worker69.com`
- **Provider:** `provider69@provider69.com` / `provider69@provider69.com`

## 🎉 Summary

The BioMVP platform is now in a **stable, functional state** with proper role-based access control. The major blocking issues have been resolved, and the foundation is solid for building out the core business workflows.

**Next developer should focus on:**
1. Building the gig application workflow (Worker applies → Lab reviews → Accept/Reject)
2. Enhancing the offerings marketplace
3. Adding real-time features and notifications
4. Polishing the user experience

The platform is ready for feature development and user testing. All authentication, navigation, and role-based functionality is working correctly.

**Happy coding! 🚀**
