# SAVEPOINT: 2025-07-02 (NIGHT)

## Summary

- Demo gig flows (posting, applying, awarding, messaging) are now fully integrated into the main Gigs userflow.
- Role-based actions and UI for Lab (Manager) and Worker (Professional) are live in the main gig details page.
- Sidebar and route links to old demo gig flows have been removed.
- Current user/role is injected from Redux, so UI updates dynamically with RoleSwitcher.
- GigsListPage and GigDetailsPage are now the core of the clickable demo for all roles.

## Key Files Changed

- `src/pages/gigs/GigDetailsPage.js` (role-based actions, demo logic merged)
- `src/pages/gigs/GigsListPage.js` (Redux integration)
- `src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.js` (removed demo links)
- `src/components/Layout/Layout.js` (removed demo routes)
- Documentation files in `/docs`

## Next Steps

- Expand mock/demo data for gigs, labs, users, and applications.
- Add more clickable flows (messaging, credential upload, payment release, etc).
- UI/UX polish and accessibility improvements.
- Final handoff documentation after all flows are integrated.

This savepoint captures the state after integrating all gig demo flows into the main userflow for a seamless clickable MVP.
