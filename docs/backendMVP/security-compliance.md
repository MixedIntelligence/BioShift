# LabLeap/BioShift Security & Compliance

This document summarizes security, privacy, and compliance considerations for the backend MVP.

---

## Authentication & Access Control
- JWT/OAuth2 for API authentication
- Role-based access (worker, lab, provider, admin)
- SSO support for institutions/partners

## Privacy & Data Protection
- Store only necessary PII; encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- GDPR and HIPAA readiness (for future clinical/biomedical data)
- Audit logging for key actions (payments, agentic actions, data access)

## Regulatory & Compliance
- NANDA integration: ensure clinical reasoning is auditable and explainable
- Payment compliance (PCI DSS for payment data)
- Data retention and deletion policies
