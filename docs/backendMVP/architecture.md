# LabLeap/BioShift Backend Architecture Overview

## Purpose
This document outlines the recommended backend architecture for the LabLeap/BioShift platform, including the Bionics agentic AI layer with NANDA integration. It is intended for developers as a starting point for backend implementation.

## High-Level Architecture
- **API Layer:** RESTful (with GraphQL extension possible)
- **Authentication:** JWT/OAuth2, SSO support
- **Core Services:**
  - User Management
  - Gig/Project Marketplace
  - Payments & Transactions
  - LabLeap Bionics/AI Layer (with NANDA)
  - Integrations (BioShift Connect)
- **Data Layer:** Relational DB (PostgreSQL recommended), with support for document/NoSQL (MongoDB) for AI logs/metadata
- **AI/Agentic Layer:** Microservice for Bionics, integrating NANDA and other LLMs
- **Integrations:** 3rd-party APIs, webhooks, notifications
- **DevOps:** Docker, CI/CD, cloud hosting (Azure/AWS/GCP)

## Bionics/AI Layer (with NANDA)
- Exposes endpoints for agentic actions, recommendations, and workflow automation
- Integrates NANDA for clinical/biomedical reasoning, task suggestions, and documentation
- Modular: can add more LLMs or AI tools
