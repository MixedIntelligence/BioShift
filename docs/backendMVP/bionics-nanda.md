# LabLeap Bionics/AI Layer & NANDA Integration

This document details the Bionics agentic AI layer, with a focus on NANDA integration for clinical/biomedical reasoning and workflow automation.

---

## Overview
The Bionics/AI layer is a modular microservice that powers agentic actions, recommendations, and workflow automation for LabLeap/BioShift users. It integrates:
- **NANDA**: For clinical/biomedical reasoning, task suggestions, and documentation support
- **LLMs**: For general agentic actions, summarization, and workflow automation

## NANDA Integration
- **Purpose**: Provide structured, evidence-based nursing/clinical reasoning and suggestions
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /bionics/nanda` â€” Accepts clinical/biomedical context, returns NANDA-based suggestions, diagnoses, and documentation templates
- **Example Request**:
```json
{
  "userId": "123",
  "context": {
    "patientData": { ... },
    "labResults": { ... },
    "task": "Suggest next steps"
  }
}
```
- **Example Response**:
```json
{
  "nandaDiagnosis": "Risk for infection",
  "suggestedInterventions": ["Monitor vital signs", "Educate on hand hygiene"],
  "documentationTemplate": "NANDA: Risk for infection..."
}
```

## Bionics Agentic Actions
- **Endpoint**: `POST /bionics/agent`
- **Input**: Context, user, task
- **Output**: Action plan, recommendations, workflow steps

## Extensibility
- Add more LLMs, AI tools, or clinical ontologies as needed
- Modular API design for future expansion
