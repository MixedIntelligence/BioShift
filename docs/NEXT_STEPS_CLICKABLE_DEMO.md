# Next Steps: Clickable Demo (Local-Only, Backend-Free)

## Purpose
This document outlines the next steps for building the LabLeap clickable demo using only local, static data. The goal is to create a fully interactive, backend-free prototype to validate user flows, UI/UX, and data requirements before backend development.

---

## 1. Project Setup & Baseline
- Ensure all code and documentation is committed to git (see `GETTING_STARTED_FIXES.md` for instructions).
- Confirm the project runs locally with `yarn start` or `npm start`.

---

## 2. Demo Data Seeding
- Create mock data files for:
  - **Lab Professionals** (e.g., `src/pages/users/mock.js`)
  - **Labs/Clients** (e.g., `src/pages/labs/mock.js`)
  - **Projects/Gigs** (e.g., `src/pages/gigs/mock.js`)
  - **Applications** (e.g., `src/pages/applications/mock.js`)
- Populate each with several realistic example entries based on the personas and user stories in the Handoff document.
- Use this data for all list/detail views, dashboards, and forms.

---

## 3. UI/UX Implementation
- Scaffold the following demo pages/routes:
  - `/gigs` – Project/Gig Listings
  - `/gigs/:id` – Project/Gig Details
  - `/post-gig` – Post a New Project (form)
  - `/dashboard` – User Dashboard (applications, posted gigs)
  - `/profile` – User Profile (view/edit)
  - `/admin/users` – Admin User List (required; use the existing admin account in the demo for access)
- Use existing components (Table, Card, Form, etc.) for rapid prototyping.
- All navigation and interactions should work with local data only (no API calls).

---

## 4. User Flows & Interactions
- Enable navigation between pages (e.g., click a gig to view details, click "Apply" to submit an application).
- Simulate state changes (e.g., after "Apply," update local application status in dashboard).
- Allow profile editing and gig posting using forms and update local data accordingly.

---

## 5. Documentation & Logging
- Log all major demo build steps in the Demo Implementation Log (see `HANDOFF.md` and `GIG_MARKETPLACE_DEMO.md`).
- Document any technical decisions, shortcuts, or issues encountered.

---

## 6. Review & Next Steps
- Use the clickable demo for user testing and stakeholder feedback.
- Collect feedback on UI/UX, data structure, and user journeys.
- Use the finalized demo data and flows to define backend API requirements and data models.
- Plan backend integration and migration from local to API-driven data.

---

## 7. Tips
- Keep all data and state 100% local (in-memory or static files) for now.
- Avoid introducing any backend or authentication dependencies until flows are validated.
- Use the personas and user stories as a reference for realistic demo content.
