# LabLeap Clickable Demo – Next Steps Roadmap

**Date:** July 2, 2025

## High-Impact Next Steps

### 1. Role-Based Navigation & User Flows
- Implement logic so the sidebar and dashboard adapt to the user’s role (Worker, Lab, Provider, Admin).
- Demo: Log in as different roles and see tailored navigation and landing pages.

### 2. Clickable User Flows
- Make all sidebar and dashboard links lead to meaningful demo pages, even if they use placeholder/mock data.
- Add “empty state” screens for pages not yet implemented.

### 3. Profile & Gig Interactions
- Enable profile editing and gig posting with local state updates.
- Simulate “Apply to Gig” and “Post a Gig” flows, updating mock data in-memory.

### 4. Dashboard Widgets
- Add simple widgets to dashboards (e.g., “My Active Gigs”, “Pending Applications”, “Lab Stats”) using your mock data.

### 5. Demo Data Enhancements
- Expand mock data for users, labs, gigs, and applications to cover more edge cases and user stories.

### 6. UI/UX Polish
- Refine page layouts, add avatars, icons, and improve mobile responsiveness.
- Add tooltips, badges, and status indicators for a more interactive feel.

### 7. Demo Walkthrough Mode
- Add a “Demo Mode” or guided walkthrough to highlight key flows for stakeholders.

**Recommended Next Step:**
Start with role-based navigation and user flows, as this will make your demo feel much more realistic and tailored for each persona. This is also the most requested feature for clickable MVPs in marketplaces.
