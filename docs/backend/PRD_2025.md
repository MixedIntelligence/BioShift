# LabLeap/BioShift Backend Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Purpose
Define the requirements and goals for the backend MVP, including the Bionics/AI (NANDA) layer, to support the LabLeap/BioShift platform.

---

## Goals
- Deliver a robust, scalable backend for the gig marketplace and agentic AI workflows
- Integrate NANDA for clinical/biomedical reasoning in the Bionics layer
- Provide secure authentication, payments, and integrations

## Core Features
- RESTful API (with GraphQL extension possible)
- User, gig, and payment management
- Bionics/AI microservice (NANDA, LLMs)
- Integrations (BioShift Connect, webhooks)
- Role-based access and audit logging

## Non-Goals
- Full EHR/clinical system (focus is on gig/marketplace and agentic workflows)
- Production-grade analytics (basic logging/monitoring only for MVP)

## Success Criteria
- All endpoints and services documented in backendMVP implemented
- Bionics/AI (NANDA) endpoints functional and testable
- Secure, deployable, and developer-friendly codebase
