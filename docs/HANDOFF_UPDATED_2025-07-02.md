## Project Overview

This codebase is a fully clickable MVP demo for BioShift/LabLeap, focused on role-based navigation, gig marketplace flows, and actionable analytics for Labs, Workers, Providers, and Admins.

## Key Features

- Role-based dashboards and navigation (Lab, Worker, Provider, Admin)
- Complete gig marketplace demo: posting, applying, awarding, messaging, credential upload, payment
- Sidebar and dashboard widgets show/hide by role
- RoleSwitcher for dynamic user/role switching
- My Gigs and Suggested pages with tabs, analytics, and rich mock data
- Suggested page for Labs and Providers enhanced with analytics (progress bars, badges, actionable suggestions) using only built-in UI components

## Data & Mocking

- Expanded mock data for users, labs, workers, providers, gigs, applications, and analytics fields
- No backend required for demo; all flows are UI-driven and update state in-memory

## UI/UX

- Consistent use of Widget, Table, Progress, Badge, and Avatar/Initials for analytics and lists
- No external chart dependencies required for demo analytics

## Code Quality

- All major lint and runtime errors resolved
- Code is modular, maintainable, and ready for further extension
