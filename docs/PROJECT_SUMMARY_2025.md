# LabLeap Project Summary

**Date:** July 2, 2025

---

## What Was Built

- A local, backend-free clickable demo for the LabLeap gig marketplace, using the Sing App React template.
- Key demo flows: Gigs List, Gig Details, Post a Gig, Lab and Worker Dashboards, all seeded with example data.
- Modern dashboard charts using proven analytics components (Highcharts-based, not Chart.js).
- Sidebar and routing updated for all new pages.
- Sidebar Projects section now features BioShift/Gig Marketplace projects with progress and relevant text.
- Dashboards (Lab, Worker, Provider) modernized and polished with analytics/admin components and BioShift-specific content.
- Documentation for onboarding, handoff, and next steps.

## Technical Highlights

- **React 18**: Upgraded and all dependencies made compatible.
- **Charting**: Switched to proven Highcharts-based components for reliability.
- **Redux**: Used for state management and mock data seeding.
- **No Backend Required**: All data is local and mock-driven for easy demoing.
