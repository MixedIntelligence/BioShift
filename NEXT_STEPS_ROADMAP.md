# Next Steps and Development Roadmap - July 5, 2025

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority 1)

### 1. Database Table Creation
**Status:** Required for full profile functionality

Missing tables that need to be created:
- `user_payments` - For banking/payment information
- `user_history` - For user activity tracking  
- `user_startups` - For startup experience tracking

**Action Items:**
1. Run the migration script `backend/models/008_profile_tables_migration.sql`
2. Test each profile tab to ensure data loads/saves correctly
3. Verify error handling works when tables are empty

### 2. Profile Page Testing
**Status:** Ready for comprehensive testing

**Test Cases:**
- [ ] Skills tab: Add/view skills
- [ ] Education tab: Add/view education entries
- [ ] Publications tab: Add/view publications
- [ ] Documents tab: Upload/view documents
- [ ] Payments tab: Add/edit payment information
- [ ] Agreements tab: View user agreements
- [ ] Transactions tab: View transaction history

### 3. Document Upload Functionality
**Status:** Needs implementation

**Required:**
- File upload handling in backend
- File storage configuration (local/cloud)
- File type validation
- File size limits
- Secure file serving

## Medium Term Goals (Priority 2)

### 1. Enhanced Profile Features
- Profile picture upload and display
- User profile visibility settings
- Profile completion progress indicator
- Skill verification system
- Education credential verification

### 2. Lab-Provider Integration
**Based on existing routes in backend/routes/profile.js:**
- Implement Lab role access to extended profiles
- Application status system between users and labs
- Profile access permissions based on application status
- Provider platform integration

### 3. Real-time Features
- Notifications system (partially implemented)
- Real-time updates for profile changes
- Activity feeds
- Messaging system

## Long Term Goals (Priority 3)

### 1. Advanced Features
- AI-powered skill recommendations
- Profile analytics and insights
- Integration with external platforms (LinkedIn, ORCID)
- Advanced search and filtering
- Profile templates by role/industry

### 2. Scalability and Performance
- Database optimization
- Caching strategy
- CDN for file storage
- API rate limiting
- Performance monitoring

### 3. Security Enhancements
- Advanced authentication (2FA)
- API security audit
- Data encryption at rest
- GDPR compliance features
- Security logging and monitoring

## Technical Debt and Improvements

### 1. Code Quality
- [ ] Add comprehensive error boundaries in React
- [ ] Implement proper logging throughout application
- [ ] Add unit tests for components and API functions
- [ ] Add integration tests for user flows
- [ ] Code documentation and JSDoc comments

### 2. API Improvements
- [ ] Consistent error response format
- [ ] API versioning strategy
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Request/response validation

### 3. Frontend Improvements
- [ ] Loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Proper form validation
- [ ] Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Mobile responsive design audit
- [ ] Performance optimization (code splitting, lazy loading)

## Deployment and DevOps

### 1. Current Status
- ✅ Development environment working
- ⚠️ Backend and frontend running separately
- ❌ Production deployment not configured

### 2. Needed Improvements
- [ ] Production build configuration
- [ ] Environment variable management
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Database migration strategy
- [ ] Monitoring and logging in production
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures

## Architecture Considerations

### 1. Current Architecture
- **Frontend:** React with Redux for state management
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** SQLite (development)
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens

### 2. Scalability Concerns
- SQLite is not suitable for production at scale
- Consider PostgreSQL or MySQL for production
- Implement connection pooling
- Consider microservices architecture for larger scale

### 3. Security Architecture
- Implement proper CORS configuration
- Add request validation middleware
- Implement API rate limiting
- Add security headers
- Regular security audits

## Recommended Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Development Process
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Implement backend API endpoints with tests
3. Implement frontend components with error handling
4. Test integration between frontend and backend
5. Update documentation
6. Code review and merge

### 2. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions and models
- Component tests for React components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Manual testing for UX validation

### 3. Documentation Standards
- Keep API documentation updated
- Document all environment variables
- Maintain deployment procedures
- Document database schema changes
- Keep troubleshooting guides current

## Success Metrics

### 1. Technical Metrics
- Page load times < 2 seconds
- API response times < 200ms
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- 99% uptime in production
- Test coverage > 80%

### 2. User Experience Metrics
- Profile completion rate
- User engagement with profile features
- Error rate in profile operations
- User feedback on profile functionality
- Time to complete profile setup

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Technical Risks
- **Database scaling:** Plan migration to production database early
- **File storage:** Implement scalable file storage solution
- **Security:** Regular security audits and updates
- **Performance:** Monitor and optimize as user base grows

### 2. Development Risks
- **Technical debt:** Allocate time for refactoring in each sprint
- **Documentation:** Keep documentation updated with each change
- **Testing:** Maintain test coverage to prevent regressions
- **Dependencies:** Regular updates and security patches
