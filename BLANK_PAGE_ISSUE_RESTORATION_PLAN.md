# BioShift (BioMVP) Blank Page & Navigation Issue Restoration Plan

**Date:** July 10, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

This document details the diagnosis, root causes, fixes, and current state of the persistent blank page and navigation issues that affected the BioShift (BioMVP) production app. It also outlines next steps for full restoration and future-proofing.

---

## 1. Root Cause Analysis

- **Primary Issue:**
  - Persistent blank page after login, missing sidebar/navigation, and non-functional main routes (especially `/app/gigs`).
- **Key Root Causes:**
  - **Race condition in authentication initialization**: Route guards and UI components attempted to access authentication state before it was ready, leading to blank renders.
  - **Improper route guard logic**: Route guards referenced global state (`window.store`) instead of Redux props, causing state desync and rendering failures.
  - **Sidebar structure dependency**: Removing the Dashboard link from the sidebar caused the entire sidebar/navigation to disappear due to CSS/structure logic.
  - **Route structure bypass**: Direct `/app/gigs` route in `App.js` bypassed the main layout, breaking navigation and sidebar rendering.

---

## 2. Steps Taken & Code Changes

- **Auth & Routing Fixes:**
  - Refactored `UserRoute` and other route guards to use Redux state via props, not `window.store`.
  - Ensured all protected routes wait for authentication state (`loadingInit`) before rendering.
  - Updated `App.js` to pass correct props and removed direct global state references.

- **Sidebar/Navigation Restoration:**
  - Removed the Dashboard link from the sidebar, which caused the sidebar to disappear.
  - Restored the Dashboard link, which brought back the sidebar and navigation.
  - Updated the logo link in the sidebar to point to `/app/gigs`.

- **Route Structure Correction:**
  - Ensured all `/app` routes are handled by `LayoutComponent` (which includes sidebar/navigation) by adding a catch-all `/app` route in `App.js`.
  - Removed direct `/app/gigs` route from `App.js` to avoid bypassing the layout.

- **Gigs Page Fix:**
  - Wired up the real `GigsListPage` to `/app/gigs` in the layout, replacing the placeholder.

- **Redux State Verification:**
  - Verified sidebar state is set to always open/static by default in `navigation.js` reducer.

- **Documentation & Commits:**
  - Multiple commits and pushes after each major change to keep the codebase in sync.

## 3. Current State

- **Sidebar & Navigation:**
  - Sidebar and navigation are restored and functional.
  - Logo and Dashboard links work as intended.

- **Main Routes:**
  - `/app/gigs` renders, but only displays "Gigs Test" (likely a placeholder).
  - "My Profile", "Edit Profile", "Chat", and "Messages" routes have no content or are not rendering the correct components.

- **No Blank Pages:**
  - No blank page after login; main UI/UX is restored.

---

## 4. Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **Browse Gigs Content:**
   - Replace the "Gigs Test" placeholder with the real gigs list in `GigsListPage`.
2. **Profile, Chat, Messages:**
   - Wire up the correct components/pages for "My Profile", "Edit Profile", "Chat", and "Messages" routes in the layout.
3. **UI/UX Parity:**
   - Ensure all sidebar links and main routes render their intended content and match the reference design.
4. **Testing:**
   - Perform full regression testing of all user flows (login, navigation, profile, gigs, etc.) to confirm no further blank pages or navigation issues.
5. **Documentation:**
   - Keep this document updated with any further changes or discoveries.

## 5. Reference Files & Key Changes

- `src/components/App.js` (main router, route guards, catch-all `/app` route)
- `src/components/Layout/Layout.js` (main layout, sidebar/header, all `/app/*` subroutes)
- `src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.js` (sidebar links, Dashboard link, logo link)
- `src/pages/gigs/GigsListPage.js` (real gigs list page)
- `src/reducers/navigation.js` (sidebar state)
- `src/reducers/auth.js` (auth state, loadingInit)
- `src/index.js` (Redux store, app initialization)
- Markdown documentation: `BLANK_PAGE_POSTMORTEM.md`, `BLANK_PAGE_BIBLE.md`, `README.md`, etc.
