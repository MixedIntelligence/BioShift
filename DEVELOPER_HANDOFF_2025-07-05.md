# Developer Handoff - BioMVP Platform Status
**Date:** July 5, 2025  
**Branch:** `BioShiftv9`  
**Commit:** `14dfbd7`

## 🚀 Current Status: RBAC Fixed & Platform Functional

The BioMVP platform is now working correctly with proper Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). The major blocking issue preventing users from seeing role-appropriate navigation and functionality has been resolved.

## ✅ What's Working Now

### Authentication & User Roles
- Backend authentication working on port 8080
- Frontend running on port 3000 with proper proxy configuration
- User registration and login functional
- JWT token validation and management working
- Roles properly stored as: `'Lab'`, `'Worker'`, `'Provider'`, `'Admin'`

### Role-Based Navigation (FIXED)
- **Lab Users** see: "Post a Gig", "My Gigs", "Browse Offerings"
- **Worker Users** see: "My Applications", "Browse Offerings", apply buttons
- **Provider Users** see: "My Offerings", "Post an Offering", "Suggested Labs"
- **Admin Users** see: Admin dashboard and all functionality

### Functional Features
- ✅ User registration for all roles
- ✅ User login/logout
- ✅ Dashboard access for all roles
- ✅ Gig listing page with role-specific buttons
- ✅ Gig posting (Lab users only)
- ✅ Offerings browsing (Lab/Worker) and management (Provider)
- ✅ Profile management
- ✅ Role-appropriate sidebar navigation

## 🔧 Recent Fixes Applied

### Critical RBAC Bug Fix
**Issue:** Role comparisons were case-sensitive but mismatched
- Database stored: `'Lab'`, `'Worker'`, `'Provider'`, `'Admin'`
- Frontend compared: `'lab'`, `'worker'`, `'provider'`, `'admin'`
- **Result:** No role-based features worked

**Solution:** Updated all frontend role comparisons to match database format

### Files Modified
```
src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.js        - Navigation menu role checks
src/pages/gigs/GigsListPage.js          - Role-specific buttons
src/pages/gigs/GigDetailsPage.js        - Lab/Worker detection
src/pages/gigs/PostGigPage.js           - Lab-only access
src/pages/gigs/SuggestedPage.js         - Role display logic
src/pages/offerings/Offerings.js        - Access control
src/components/RoleSwitcher.js          - DELETED (causing infinite loops)
src/components/Layout/Layout.js         - Cleaned up RoleSwitcher refs
```

### Stability Improvements
- Removed RoleSwitcher component that was causing React infinite loop errors
- Fixed token validation and cleanup
- Improved error handling in authentication flow
- Added debug logging for initialization process

## 🚧 Next Development Priorities

### High Priority (Ready to Implement)
1. **Gig Application Workflow**
   - Worker applies to gig → Lab reviews → Accept/Reject flow
   - Email notifications for status changes
   - Application tracking for Workers

2. **Enhanced Gig Management**
   - Lab users edit/delete their posted gigs
   - Gig status management (Open/In Progress/Completed)
   - Applicant management interface for Labs

3. **Offerings Marketplace**
   - Provider posting and management of offerings
   - Lab/Worker browsing and inquiring about offerings
   - Provider-Lab connection workflow

### Medium Priority
4. **Real-time Features**
   - Chat between Labs and Workers
   - Real-time notifications
   - Status update notifications

5. **Advanced Search & Filtering**
   - Skills-based gig matching
   - Location filtering
   - Salary range filtering

6. **Payment Integration**
   - Stripe/PayPal integration
   - Milestone-based payments
   - Payment dispute resolution

## 🛠️ Development Environment

### Starting the Servers
```powershell
# Backend (Terminal 1)
cd "c:\Users\Chad-Main\Desktop\BioMVP\v9"
npm run start:backend

# Frontend (Terminal 2) 
cd "c:\Users\Chad-Main\Desktop\BioMVP\v9"
npm run start:frontend
```

### Database
- SQLite database: `backend/biomvp.sqlite`
- DB access via: `backend/models/db.js`
- Sample users exist for all roles

### Testing Credentials
Test users exist in database - check `SEED_CREDENTIALS.md` or query users table.
Example: `lab69@lab69.com` / `lab69@lab69.com`

### Git Workflow
```powershell
git checkout BioShiftv9
git pull origin BioShiftv9
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive message"
git push
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Minor Issues
- Some SASS deprecation warnings (not blocking)
- Hot-reload proxy errors for non-API requests (cosmetic)
- Babel configuration warning in SuggestedPage (doesn't affect functionality)

### Areas Needing Attention
- Error handling could be more user-friendly
- Loading states could be improved
- Some UI components need responsive design improvements
- Test coverage needs to be added

## 💡 Development Tips

### Adding New Role-Based Features
Always use the capitalized role format:
```javascript
if (currentUser?.role === 'Lab') {
  // Lab-specific logic
}
```

### Database Queries
Use the models in `backend/models/` for consistency:
```javascript
const user = await userModel.findUserById(userId);
const gigs = await gigModel.getAllGigs();
```

### Testing Role Changes
Use browser dev tools to inspect `currentUser` in Redux store:
```javascript
// In browser console
store.getState().auth.currentUser
```

## 📞 Quick Reference

### Common Commands
```powershell
# Check what's running on ports
netstat -ano | Select-String ":3000"
netstat -ano | Select-String ":8080"

# Database queries
cd backend
node -e "const db = require('./models/db'); console.log(db.prepare('SELECT * FROM users').all()); db.close();"

# Git status
git status
git log --oneline -10
```

### Environment Notes
- **OS:** Windows (PowerShell environment)
- **Node.js:** v20.19.2
- **Database:** SQLite with better-sqlite3
- **Frontend:** React with Redux
- **Backend:** Express.js with JWT auth

---

**Ready to continue development!** The platform foundation is solid and role-based functionality is working. Focus on building out the core workflows (gig applications, offerings marketplace) and adding polish to the user experience.
