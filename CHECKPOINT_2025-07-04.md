## 1. Current Status

The LabLeap v9 MVP is feature-complete for the closed beta test. All core functionality has been implemented, and the application is in a stable, runnable state.

### Completed Epics:
*   **The "Connect" Workflow:** Labs can now accept and reject applicants.
*   **Document & Credential Management (MVP):** Users can upload and manage documents.
*   **Notification System (MVP):** Users receive notifications for key events.
*   **Data Privacy & Visibility Rules:** Role-based access control and data privacy rules have been implemented.

## 2. Next Steps: Payments & Banking

The next phase of development will focus on implementing the "Payments & Banking" features, as detailed in the `PAYMENTS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

### Stripe Integration:
The initial Stripe integration has been completed using the Stripe MCP tool. The following has been done:
*   A test customer has been created.
*   A "LabLeap Pro Subscription" product has been created.
*   A price has been created for the product.
*   A payment link has been created for the price.
*   A "Subscribe to LabLeap Pro" button has been added to the `Offerings` page, which redirects to the Stripe payment link.

### Banking & Payouts:
The next epic to be implemented is "Banking & Payouts". The first step is to create the `bank_accounts` table in the database. The migration file for this has been created, but the migration has not yet been run successfully.
