# Welcome to the LabLeap Beta!

Thank you for being one of the very first people to use LabLeap! We're incredibly excited to have you on board. Your feedback is essential in helping us build the best platform for connecting labs and scientists for short-term "gigs."

This guide will walk you through the core features of the application. Please don't hesitate to explore, click around, and see what happens. You can't break anything, and the more you use the app, the more valuable your feedback will be.

## Getting Started

First things first, let's get you set up.

### 1. Creating Your Account

When you first sign up, you'll need to choose your account type:

*   **Are you a Lab?** Choose the **"Lab"** account. This will allow you to post gigs and hire talented scientists.
*   **Are you a Scientist?** Choose the **"Worker"** account. This will let you find and apply for exciting new opportunities.

Follow the on-screen prompts to complete your registration.

### 2. Logging In

Once your account is created, you can log in anytime using the email and password you registered with.

## Managing Your Profile

Your profile is your professional snapshot on LabLeap. A complete and up-to-date profile is key to finding the right match.

Navigate to the **"Profile"** section to:
*   **Add Your Skills:** Let others know what you're great at.
*   **List Your Education:** Detail your academic background.
*   **Upload Documents:** You can upload your CV, certifications, or other relevant documents to support your profile.

For Labs, a complete profile helps scientists understand your organization and the work you do. For Scientists, it's your chance to shine and stand out to labs.

## The Gig Workflow

This is the core of LabLeap! Hereâ€™s how it works from both sides.

### For Scientists: Finding & Applying for Gigs

1.  **Find Gigs:** Navigate to the "Gigs" section to browse all available opportunities. You can search and filter to find the ones that match your skills and interests.
2.  **View Gig Details:** Click on any gig to see the full details, including the required skills, project duration, and information about the lab.
3.  **Apply:** See a gig you like? Hit the "Apply" button! The lab will be notified that you're interested.

### For Labs: Posting Gigs & Finding Talent

1.  **Post a New Gig:** Go to the "Gigs" section and click "Post New Gig." Fill out the form with as much detail as possible to attract the right scientists.
2.  **Review Applicants:** When a scientist applies to your gig, you'll receive a notification. You can view a list of all applicants for your gig and review their profiles to see their skills, experience, and qualifications.

## Making the Connection

This is where it all comes together.

*   When a **Lab** decides to move forward with a scientist, they will click **"Accept"** on their application.
*   Once accepted, **both the Lab and the Scientist will receive a notification.**
*   This notification will contain the other party's contact information (email and phone number).

From there, you can connect directly outside of the LabLeap platform to discuss next steps like interviews, contracts, and project details.

## Banking & Payouts

In the "Banking" or "Payouts" section of your profile, you can securely add your bank account information. While direct payments are not part of this beta, setting this up now will ensure you're ready for seamless payouts in the future.

## How to Share Your Feedback (This is Important!)

Your honest feedback is the most valuable part of this beta test. If you see something that doesn't work, is confusing, or could be better, we want to know!

### What to Report:

*   **Bugs:** Anything that seems broken or doesn't work as you'd expect.
*   **Suggestions:** Ideas for new features or improvements to existing ones.
*   **Confusing Areas:** Parts of the app that were hard to understand or navigate.
*   **General Impressions:** What do you like? What do you dislike?

### How to Report:

Please send all feedback via email to **feedback@lableap.com**.

To help us fix bugs quickly, please include these details in your report:
1.  **What you were trying to do.** (e.g., "I was trying to upload my CV.")
2.  **What you expected to happen.** (e.g., "I expected to see the file name appear after I selected it.")
3.  **What actually happened.** (e.g., "I got an error message that said 'Upload Failed', and the page reloaded.")
4.  A screenshot of the page is always helpful!
