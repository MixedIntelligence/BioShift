# Deployment Status Update - July 6, 2025

## 🎯 **CURRENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS**

### ✅ **Frontend (Vercel) - LIVE & WORKING**
- **URL**: https://bioshift-seven.vercel.app
- **Status**: ✅ 200 OK
- **Performance**: Fast and responsive
- **Last Deploy**: July 6, 2025
- **Branch**: BioShiftv9

### 🔧 **Backend (Railway) - FIXING IN PROGRESS**
- **URL**: https://bioshift-production.up.railway.app
- **Status**: 🔄 Building (fixing binary compatibility)
- **Issue**: better-sqlite3 ELF header binary mismatch
- **Solution Applied**: Enhanced nixpacks.toml configuration
- **ETA**: 10-15 minutes for rebuild completion

---

## 🐛 **RAILWAY ISSUE DIAGNOSIS**

### Problem Identified:
```
Error: /app/node_modules/better-sqlite3/build/Release/better_sqlite3.node: invalid ELF header
```

This indicates that the SQLite binary was compiled for a different architecture than Railway's runtime environment.

### Solution Applied:
1. **Enhanced nixpacks.toml**:
   - Added `gcc-unwrapped` for proper compilation
   - Force rebuild of better-sqlite3 from source
   - Added build environment variables (CC, CXX, PYTHON)
   - Clean node_modules and package-lock.json before build

2. **Backup Strategy**:
   - Created `Dockerfile.railway` as alternative deployment method
   - Uses Alpine Linux with proper build dependencies

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

### Immediate (Next 15 minutes):
1. **Monitor Railway Rebuild** - Check deployment logs
2. **Test Backend Health** - Run deployment_check.js once complete
3. **Verify API Endpoints** - Ensure all endpoints respond correctly

### Once Railway is Fixed:
1. **Full Integration Test** - Frontend ↔ Backend communication
2. **Beta Testing Launch** - Platform will be 100% ready
3. **User Onboarding** - Begin beta tester invitations
