# July 8 Recap

## Overview
Today was focused on getting the BioShift (BioMVP) platform running locally with a working Postgres database, resolving frontend/backend connection issues, and restoring the ability to log in and develop locally. The process involved debugging, environment setup, and database migration from Railway to local Postgres.

---

## Key Steps and Events

### 1. Debugging the Frontend
- Identified that the frontend was showing blank or placeholder pages due to test routes in `App.js`.
- Restored real routes for `LandingPage`, `Login`, and `Register` components.
- Fixed the frontend API URL to point to the correct backend port (5000 instead of 8080).

### 2. Backend Connection Issues
- Discovered that the backend was running but could not connect to a database, resulting in 500 errors on login/register.
- Confirmed that no local Postgres database was set up yet.

### 3. Postgres Setup and Password Reset
- Guided through finding and/or resetting the Postgres password using PGAdmin and, if needed, by editing `pg_hba.conf`.
- Explained how to create a new database in PGAdmin and get connection details.

### 4. Migrating Data from Railway
- Located the Railway Postgres public connection string.
- Installed and configured `pg_dump` by adding the Postgres `bin` directory to the system PATH.
- Used `pg_dump` to export the full schema and data from Railway to a local `full_dump.sql` file.
- Created a new local database in PGAdmin and imported the dump using `psql`.

### 5. Environment Configuration
- Created a new `backend/.env` file with a secure JWT secret and a template for the local database connection string.
- Provided instructions to update the password in the connection string and restart the backend.

## Frustrations and Solutions
- Encountered multiple issues with missing tools (`pg_dump`), PATH configuration, and Postgres authentication.
- Faced confusion with Railway’s internal vs. public connection strings.
- Overcame tedious steps by breaking down each process and providing clear, actionable instructions.

---

## Status at End of Day
- Local Postgres database is set up and matches the production schema/data from Railway.
- Backend `.env` is configured with a working JWT secret and database connection string.
- Frontend and backend are ready for local development and testing.
- Next steps: restart backend, test login/register, and continue development with a working local stack.

---

**Summary:**
Today was a marathon of environment setup, database migration, and troubleshooting. Despite the frustration, you now have a working local development environment that mirrors production. Take a break—you earned it!
