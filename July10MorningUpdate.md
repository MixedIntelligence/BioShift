# July 10 Morning Update

## Blank Page Debugging

### Issue

All pages under the `/app` route were showing up as blank pages after user login. This included:

*   Browse Gigs
*   My Profile
*   Edit Profile
*   Chat
*   Messages

### Diagnosis

The root cause of the issue was a misconfiguration in the routing within the `src/components/Layout/Layout.js` file.

1.  A test route for `/app/gigs` was overriding the actual component, causing the page to display only "Gigs Test."
2.  Routes for `/app/profile`, `/app/edit_profile`, `/app/chat`, and `/app/inbox` were missing from the `Switch` statement in `Layout.js`.

### Resolution

1.  Removed the conflicting test route for `/app/gigs`.
2.  Added the missing routes for `/app/profile`, `/app/chat`, and `/app/inbox` to the `Switch` statement in `src/components/Layout/Layout.js`.
3.  The `/app/edit_profile` route was not added as there is no existing component for it. The "Edit Profile" functionality is handled within the `Profile` component.
