# Vercel Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Check ‚úÖ

### Build Configuration
- ‚úÖ `vercel-build` script configured  
- ‚úÖ `build` script with proper flags
- ‚úÖ `vercel.json` configuration file ready
- ‚úÖ Dependencies up to date

### Code Status
- ‚úÖ All changes committed to Git
- ‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub (`BioShiftv9` branch)
- ‚úÖ Landing page updated
- ‚úÖ Documentation current

## Vercel Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Access Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Click "Log in" or "Sign up"
3. Choose "Continue with GitHub" 

### Step 2: Import Project
1. Click "Add New..." ‚Üí "Project"
2. Find "BioShift" repository in the list
3. Click "Import" next to BioShift

### Step 3: Configure Deployment
**Root Directory:** `./` (should auto-detect)
**Framework Preset:** Create React App (should auto-detect)
**Build Command:** `npm run vercel-build` 
**Output Directory:** `build` (should auto-detect)
**Install Command:** `npm install` (should auto-detect)

### Step 4: Advanced Settings (Optional)
**Environment Variables:** None needed for frontend-only deployment
**Node.js Version:** 18.x (default should work)

### Step 5: Deploy
1. Select branch: `BioShiftv9`
2. Click "Deploy"
3. Wait for build process (2-5 minutes)

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Successful Deployment
- Build completes without errors
- Site accessible at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
- Landing page loads correctly
- Navigation works (though backend features won't work yet)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues

#### Build Errors
- **Memory issues**: Vercel may need Node.js 18+
- **Dependency issues**: Old packages may cause warnings

#### Runtime Issues  
- **API calls fail**: Expected - backend not deployed yet
- **Images not loading**: Check if all images are in `public/` folder
- **Styling issues**: CSS imports should work fine

## Troubleshooting Commands

If you need to test the build locally first:
```powershell
cd 'c:\Users\Chad-Main\Desktop\BioMVP\v9'
npm run build
```

This will create a `build/` folder you can inspect.

## Post-Deployment

### Frontend Testing Checklist
- [ ] Landing page loads and looks good
- [ ] Navigation menu works  
- [ ] Registration page accessible
- [ ] Login page accessible
- [ ] Browse gigs page loads (may show errors due to no backend)

### Next Phase: Backend Deployment
Once frontend is deployed, we'll need to:
1. Deploy backend to Railway/Render/Heroku
2. Update API configuration in `src/config.js`
3. Redeploy frontend with backend URL

## Ready to Deploy! üöÄ

Your project is ready for Vercel deployment. The frontend should deploy successfully, giving you a live URL to share and test.
