# LabLeap Project Status & Code-Level Analysis

## 1. Conclusion and Readiness Assessment

The LabLeap project is a partially implemented prototype that is **not ready to accept customers**. While the foundational work of connecting the frontend to the backend is largely complete, the core user workflow is broken at critical points.

The project is significantly closer to being a true MVP than the initial documentation review suggested, but it is still several key features away from being viable.

**Critical Path to Customer Readiness:**

1.  **Implement the Applicant Profile View:** A lab must be able to view the profile of a scientist who has applied to their gig. This is the highest priority.
2.  **Complete the "Connect" Workflow:** The system must provide contact information to both parties upon acceptance to close the loop and enable an actual connection.
3.  **Implement the "Minimum Viable Profile" Gate:** This is essential to ensure the quality of the marketplace and prevent a poor user experience for labs.

Until these three issues are addressed, the application cannot fulfill its core promise of connecting labs with scientists and is not ready for a beta test, let alone paying customers.

## 2. Code-Level Analysis vs. The Revival Plan

My analysis of the codebase reveals that the development team has made a concerted effort to follow the [`TECHNICAL_REVIVAL_PLAN.md`](TECHNICAL_REVIVAL_PLAN.md:1), but critical gaps remain.

### 2.1. Frontend Implementation Status

*   **API Service Layer:** **Completed**. A centralized API service exists at [`src/services/api.js`](src/services/api.js:1) and correctly handles API calls and JWT authentication, as planned.
*   **Gig Listing and Details:** **Completed**. The gig list page ([`src/pages/gigs/GigsListPage.js`](src/pages/gigs/GigsListPage.js:1)) and details page ([`src/pages/gigs/GigDetailsPage.js`](src/pages/gigs/GigDetailsPage.js:1)) successfully fetch and display live data from the backend, replacing the old mock data.
*   **Application Workflow:** **Partially Completed**.
    *   A scientist **can** apply for a gig. The "Apply" button on the [`GigDetailsPage.js`](src/pages/gigs/GigDetailsPage.js:180) is functional and correctly calls the `POST /api/gigs/:id/apply` endpoint.
    *   A lab **can** view a list of applicants within a tab on the [`GigDetailsPage.js`](src/pages/gigs/GigDetailsPage.js:194). This view correctly fetches data from the `GET /api/gigs/:id/applications` endpoint ([`src/pages/gigs/GigDetailsPage.js:77`](src/pages/gigs/GigDetailsPage.js:77)).
    *   A lab **can** accept or reject an application. The "Accept" and "Reject" buttons are functional and trigger the correct backend endpoints ([`src/pages/gigs/GigDetailsPage.js:38`](src/pages/gigs/GigDetailsPage.js:38), [`src/pages/gigs/GigDetailsPage.js:49`](src/pages/gigs/GigDetailsPage.js:49)).
*   **Critical Missing Frontend Features:**
    *   **Applicant Profile View:** **Not Implemented**. There is no mechanism for a lab to click on an applicant's name to view their profile. This is a major gap in the workflow, as labs cannot evaluate candidates.
    *   **Minimum Viable Profile Gate:** **Not Implemented**. The planned check to ensure a scientist's profile is complete before they can apply for a gig does not exist.

### 2.2. Backend Implementation Status

*   **API Endpoints:** **Mostly Completed**. The necessary routes for managing gigs and applications are in place.
    *   [`backend/routes/gigs.js`](backend/routes/gigs.js:1) contains the endpoints for listing, creating, and applying to gigs.
    *   [`backend/routes/applications.js`](backend/routes/applications.js:1) contains the endpoints for accepting and rejecting applications.
*   **Database Models:** **Completed**. The data models for gigs ([`backend/models/gig.js`](backend/models/gig.js:1)) and applications ([`backend/models/application.js`](backend/models/application.js:1)) are implemented and handle the required database interactions.
*   **The "Connect" Workflow:** **Incomplete**.
    *   The plan specified that upon acceptance, both the lab and the scientist would receive each other's contact email to facilitate an off-platform connection.
    *   The current implementation only provides the scientist's email to the lab via an alert in the UI ([`src/pages/gigs/GigDetailsPage.js:223`](src/pages/gigs/GigDetailsPage.js:223)). The scientist receives a notification that they have been accepted but does **not** receive the lab's contact information, creating a dead end in the workflow.
