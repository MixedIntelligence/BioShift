# Navigation & Sidebar Restoration Status â€” July 10, 2025

## Summary
The sidebar and navigation have been restored in the BioShift (BioMVP) production app. The main UI is now functional after login, and the sidebar/navigation is visible and operational. However, several routes still display placeholder content or lack implementation.

---

## Steps Taken
1. **Diagnosed Root Causes:**
   - Identified race condition in authentication initialization (auth state not ready before rendering)
   - Found route guards using global state (`window.store`) instead of Redux props
   - Sidebar disappearance traced to removal of the Dashboard link
   - Route structure allowed bypassing the main layout

2. **Code Refactoring & Fixes:**
   - Refactored route guards (`UserRoute`, etc.) to use Redux state via props
   - Ensured all protected routes wait for `loadingInit` before rendering
   - Updated `App.js` to pass correct props and removed direct `/app/gigs` route
   - Wired up the real `GigsListPage` to `/app/gigs` in the layout
   - Added a catch-all `/app` route in `App.js` to ensure all `/app` pages use `LayoutComponent` (with sidebar/navigation)
   - Restored the Dashboard link in the sidebar
   - Updated logo link in sidebar to `/app/gigs`

3. **Documentation:**
   - Created and updated `BLANK_PAGE_ISSUE_RESTORATION_PLAN.md` and related postmortems
   - Committed and pushed changes after each major step

## Current State
- **Sidebar & Navigation:** Fully restored and functional
- **Browse Gigs:** Route `/app/gigs` displays the sidebar and layout, but the main content is still a placeholder ("Gigs Test")
- **My Profile, Edit Profile, Chat, Messages:** Routes exist but have no content or are not wired up to real components
- **All other UI:** Main layout and navigation flows are working as intended

---

## Remaining Issues / Next Steps
- Replace the "Gigs Test" placeholder in `/app/gigs` with the real gigs list content
- Wire up correct components/pages for:
  - My Profile
  - Edit Profile
  - Chat
  - Messages
- Ensure all sidebar links and main routes render their intended content and match the reference design
- Perform full regression testing of all user flows (login, navigation, profile, gigs, etc.)
- Keep documentation updated with further changes or discoveries
