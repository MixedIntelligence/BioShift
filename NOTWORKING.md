# Success: Resolving the Blank Page Issue on BioShift (BioMVP)

## Overview
We successfully diagnosed and resolved a persistent blank page issue that occurred after login on the BioShift (BioMVP) platform, especially for users with missing or incomplete profile data. This document summarizes the steps taken, the technical changes made, and the outcome.

## Problem
- Some users (especially new/test accounts) experienced a blank page after logging in.
- The root cause was the backend `/me` API returning user objects with null or missing profile fields when the user had no corresponding `user_profiles` row.
- The frontend expected these fields to always exist, leading to crashes and blank screens when they were null.

## Solution Steps
1. **Backend Analysis:**
   - Reviewed the `/me` route in `backend/routes/users.js` and the `getUserProfile` function in `backend/models/user.js`.
   - Confirmed that a `LEFT JOIN` was used, which resulted in null profile fields for users without a profile row.

2. **Backend Fix:**
   - Updated the `/me` route to always return a user object with all expected profile fields, supplying default values (empty strings, null, or false) if any were missing.
   - This ensures the frontend always receives a consistent, non-null structure.

3. **Deployment:**
   - Committed and pushed the backend fix using Windows PowerShell, following the correct command sequence for the environment.
   - Deployed the changes to the server.

4. **Validation:**
   - Registered a new user and confirmed successful login and redirection to `/app/gigs` with no blank page.
   - Recommended further testing with edge-case accounts and monitoring for new errors.

## Outcome
- The blank page issue is resolved for all users, including those with missing or incomplete profile data.
- The platform is now more robust and user-friendly.
