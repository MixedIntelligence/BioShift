# LabLeap v9 MVP Revival - Handoff Document (July 4, 7:38 AM)

## 1. Current Status

**Objective:** To revive the LabLeap v9 MVP for a closed beta test.

**Working:**
*   The backend server is running.
*   The frontend application compiles with warnings.
*   User registration flow is functional with role selection (Worker, Lab, Provider).
*   User profile pages are stable and no longer crash.
*   Authentication is working correctly.
*   A new landing page serves as the application's entry point.
*   "Provider Offerings" feature is implemented.
*   "Post a Gig" feature is implemented for Labs.
*   The "Connect" workflow (accepting/rejecting applicants) is implemented.
*   Document management and a notification system are in place.

**Broken:**
*   The application still has some known ESLint and SASS deprecation warnings that do not affect functionality.

## 2. Summary of Changes

*   **Authentication:**
    *   Fixed the `jwt malformed` error by correcting the token handling in the `auth` action.
    *   Transitioned from a username-based to an email-based authentication system.
    *   The `users` table in the database was migrated to use an `email` column.
*   **Registration:**
    *   Created a new landing page at the root URL (`/`) that directs users to role-specific registration pages.
    *   The registration form now includes a "Role" dropdown that is pre-filled based on the registration link clicked.
    *   The `Register.js` component was updated to handle the new role selection and to use a centralized `isAuthenticated` utility function.
*   **Profile Pages:**
    *   Fixed the profile page crashes by connecting the components to the Redux store to access the authenticated user's ID.
*   **Provider Offerings:**
    *   Implemented a new "Provider Offerings" feature, allowing users with the "Provider" role to post and manage their services.
    *   This included creating a new `provider_offerings` table in the database, a new data model, and new API routes.
    *   The frontend was updated with new pages for creating, viewing, and listing offerings.
*   **Gig Posting:**
    *   Implemented a "Post a Gig" feature for users with the "Lab" role.
*   **Connect Workflow:**
    *   Implemented the "Connect" workflow, allowing Labs to accept or reject applications for their gigs.
*   **Notifications:**
    *   A notification system was implemented to alert users of relevant events.
*   **Document Management:**
    *   Users can now upload and manage documents on their profile.

## 3. Next Steps

*   Conduct a final round of end-to-end testing on all implemented features.
*   Address the remaining ESLint and SASS warnings to ensure a clean build process.
*   Prepare for the closed beta launch.
