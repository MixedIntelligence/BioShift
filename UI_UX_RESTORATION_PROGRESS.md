# BioShift UI/UX Restoration Progress Report

**Date:** July 9, 2025

## Summary
- The BioShift platform experienced major UI/UX inconsistencies after a blank page/infinite redirect bug was fixed.
- The login/register/auth pages and other UI elements looked visually different from the reference implementation, despite nearly identical code.

## Investigation Steps
1. **Checked `index.js` imports:**
   - Bootstrap, `app.scss`, and now `theme.scss` are imported at the top, matching the reference.
2. **Compared `app.scss` and `_variables.scss`:**
   - Both files are present and identical in current and reference repos.
3. **Inspected `Widget` component and `Widget.module.scss`:**
   - Both the component and its SCSS are present and match the reference exactly.
4. **Confirmed no missing or broken imports for global/component styles.**

## Current Hypotheses for UI Differences (Resolved)
- SCSS/CSS was not being loaded or applied at runtime due to missing `theme.scss` import.
- Line Awesome icons and other theme styles were missing as a result.

## Actions Taken
- Added the missing import for `theme.scss` in `src/index.js`.
- Confirmed that Line Awesome icons (e.g., animated cogs) and all theme styles now load and display correctly.
- Verified that the UI now matches the reference implementation, including fonts, icons, and element sizing.

## Status: **COMPLETE**
- The UI/UX restoration is finished. The app now visually matches the reference version.
- All major issues with fonts, icons, and theme styles are resolved.
