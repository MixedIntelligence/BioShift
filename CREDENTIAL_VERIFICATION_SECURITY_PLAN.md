# Credential Verification Security & Compliance Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the security and compliance plan for the Third-Party Credential Verification feature. The plan ensures that sensitive user data is handled securely, our APIs are protected, and we comply with relevant data privacy regulations.

## 2. Data Handling

### Data Collection
- **User Consent:** Before initiating the verification process, we will obtain explicit consent from the user. The consent form will clearly state what data is being collected, why it's being collected, and that it will be shared with a third-party service for verification.
- **Data Minimization:** We will only collect the minimum data necessary for verification. This may include:
    - Full Name
    - Name of the Institution
    - Degree/Certification Name
    - Year of Graduation/Completion
    - A scanned copy of the certificate or transcript (if required by the third-party service).

### Data Storage
- **Encryption at Rest:** All user data, especially sensitive documents, will be stored encrypted in our database using AES-256 encryption.
- **Temporary Storage:** Scanned documents will be stored temporarily and will be permanently deleted after the verification process is complete, or after a maximum of 30 days if the verification is pending. The verification result (e.g., "Verified," "Not Verified," "In Progress") will be stored permanently.

### Data Transmission
- **Encryption in Transit:** All data transmitted between our client, our server, and the third-party verification service will be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- **Data Sent to Third-Party:** We will only send the necessary information for the third-party to perform the verification. This will be clearly defined in the agreement with the selected vendor.
- **Data Received from Third-Party:** We will receive a status of the verification (e.g., success, failure, pending) and a verification ID. We will not receive or store any additional personal data from the third-party service.

## 3. API Security

Our internal API endpoints for credential verification will be secured as follows:

- **Authentication:** All endpoints will require authenticated users. API requests must include a valid JWT token.
- **Authorization:** Only the user who owns the credential can initiate a verification request. Admins may have specific, limited access for support purposes, which will be logged.
- **Input Validation:** All incoming data will be strictly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- **Rate Limiting:** To prevent abuse, we will implement rate limiting on the verification endpoints (e.g., a user can only initiate a certain number of verifications per hour).
- **Logging and Monitoring:** All API requests and responses for the verification process will be logged for security auditing and monitoring for suspicious activity.

## 4. Third-Party Service Selection Criteria

The selection of a third-party verification service is critical. The chosen vendor must meet the following criteria:

- **Security Certifications:** The vendor must have recognized security certifications, such as SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001, or equivalent.
- **Compliance:** The vendor must be compliant with major data privacy regulations, including GDPR and CCPA. They must be willing to sign a Data Processing Addendum (DPA).
- **Reputation:** The vendor must have a strong reputation and a proven track record in providing credential verification services.
- **Data Handling Policies:** The vendor's data handling and retention policies must be transparent and align with our own. We need to know how long they store data and for what purpose.
- **API Security:** The vendor's API must be secure, well-documented, and provide robust authentication mechanisms.

## 5. Compliance

- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):**
    - **Lawful Basis for Processing:** User consent will be our lawful basis for processing data.
    - **Data Subject Rights:** We will have processes in place to handle user requests for data access, rectification, and erasure (Right to be Forgotten).
    - **Data Processing Addendum (DPA):** We will sign a DPA with the chosen third-party vendor.
- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act):**
    - **Notice at Collection:** We will inform users at or before the point of data collection about the categories of personal information being collected and the purposes for which they are used.
    - **Right to Opt-Out:** While we are not "selling" data, we will provide clear information on how data is shared and allow users to opt-out of the verification process.
- **Data Breach Notification:** We will have a clear data breach response plan in place. In the event of a breach involving this data, we will notify affected users and relevant authorities as required by law.

## 6. User Experience & Privacy

- **Verification Status Storage:** The final verification status (e.g., "Verified," "Not Verified") will be stored in our database, linked to the user's profile.
- **Display of Verification Status:**
    - A "Verified" badge or icon will be displayed on the scientist's public profile next to the specific credential.
    - We will not display "Not Verified" or "Pending" statuses publicly. This information is only visible to the user and our platform administrators.
    - When a lab views a scientist's profile, they will see the "Verified" badge, providing trust and credibility. The underlying sensitive data (like a transcript) will never be visible to the lab.
- **User Control:** Users will have the ability to manage their verified credentials, including the option to remove a credential and its verification status from their profile at any time.
