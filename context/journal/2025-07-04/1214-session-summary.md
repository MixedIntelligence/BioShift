## 1. Accomplishments

- **Core User Flows Verified:** Successfully tested and confirmed the end-to-end functionality of the three primary user flows required for the closed beta:
    - **Lab Flow:** Verified user registration, gig posting, and viewing applicants.
    - **Worker Flow:** Verified user registration, viewing available gigs, and applying to gigs.
    - **Provider Flow:** Verified user registration, posting new offerings, and viewing the list of offerings.
- **Full Backend Connectivity:** All core user flows are now fully connected to the backend API, replacing all mock data with live data.
- **API Service Layer Complete:** The `src/services/api.js` module is now complete, with functions to handle all necessary API interactions for the beta features.
- **Project Stability:** Resolved multiple frontend compilation errors and backend data inconsistencies, resulting in a stable, testable application.

## 2. Current Status

- The application is now feature-complete for the closed beta test.
- All three user roles (Lab, Worker, Provider) can perform their primary actions within the marketplace.
- The foundational "Connect" workflow, which allows Labs to accept and reject applicants, is fully implemented.

## 3. Next Steps

The immediate next steps will focus on implementing the remaining MVP features outlined in the `BETA_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:

- **Document & Credential Management:** Connect the existing frontend components to the backend to allow users to upload and view documents.
- **Notification System:** Implement the backend logic and frontend UI for the real-time notification system.
- **Data Privacy & Visibility Rules:** Secure the `users` API endpoint to ensure that sensitive user data is only exposed to authorized roles.
