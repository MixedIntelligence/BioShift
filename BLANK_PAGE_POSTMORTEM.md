# Blank Page Issue: Postmortem & Solution Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the diagnosis and resolution of the critical "Blank Page" issue that affected protected route navigation after login in the BioMVP platform.

---

## Problem Description
- After login, navigating to any protected route (e.g., via sidebar links) resulted in a blank page.
- The DOM root was empty, and no errors appeared in the console except a routing warning.

## Root Cause
- A race condition between the initial render and the asynchronous authentication check (`doInit()`).
- Protected routes were rendered before the user's authentication state was confirmed, causing the router to treat the user as unauthenticated and redirect (or render nothing).

## Diagnostic Steps
1. **Observed** blank page after login and navigation.
2. **Inspected DOM:** root `<div>` was empty.
3. **Checked localStorage:** valid JWT token present.
4. **Console log:** routing warning about pushing the same path.
5. **Code review:** found that routes rendered before `doInit()` completed.

## Solution
1. **Added `loadingInit` flag** to Redux auth state, defaulting to `true` and set to `false` after `doInit()` completes.
2. **Modified `App` component** to show a loading message while `loadingInit` is `true` and only render routes after auth is initialized.
3. **Added missing routes** to `LayoutComponent` for all sidebar links.
4. **Fixed component errors** (e.g., undefined variables in Dashboard).
5. **Set required environment variables** (e.g., `NODE_ENV=development` in `.env`).

## Result
- The app now waits for authentication to complete before rendering protected routes.
- All sidebar links work, and routing/rendering are stable.
- All previously identified issues (blank page, routing errors, component reference errors, and build config) are resolved.
