# LabLeap: Comprehensive Status & Roadmap

**Date:** July 5, 2025

## 1. Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the LabLeap project, including a detailed analysis of its current state, a revised roadmap to a true Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and a strategic plan for deployment. It is intended to be the single source of truth for the development team moving forward.

## 2. Current Status: A Feature-by-Feature Analysis

Our deep-dive analysis of the codebase reveals that the LabLeap project is a **partially implemented prototype that is not ready for customers**. While the foundational work of connecting the frontend to the backend is largely complete for the core "Connect" workflow, other key features are either not implemented or exist only as static mockups.

### 2.1. The Core "Connect" Workflow

*   **Status:** **Mostly Complete**.
*   **Implemented:**
    *   Users can register and log in with email-based authentication.
    *   The frontend is fully integrated with the backend API for the core workflow.
    *   Labs can post gigs and view applicants.
    *   Workers can browse gigs and apply.
    *   Labs can view the full profile of any applicant.
    *   The system facilitates a two-way connection by notifying both parties with contact information when an application is accepted.
*   **Missing:**
    *   The "Minimum Viable Profile" gate, which would prevent users with incomplete profiles from applying to gigs, has not been implemented.

### 2.2. Providers and Offerings

*   **Status:** **Partially Implemented**.
*   **Frontend:** The UI components for listing, viewing, and creating offerings are in place and connected to the API service.
*   **Backend:** The API endpoints and database models for managing offerings are fully implemented.
*   **Missing:** The frontend is still using some mock data, and the integration with the user's role is not complete.

### 2.3. BioShift Connect

*   **Status:** **Not Implemented**.
*   **Frontend:** The `Connect.js` page is a static, informational page with no real functionality. The "Connect" and "Configure" buttons are placeholders.
*   **Backend:** There are no backend routes or models to support this feature.

### 2.4. Bionics

*   **Status:** **Not Implemented**.
*   **Frontend:** The `Bionics.js` page is a static, informational page that describes the vision for the feature but does not contain any real functionality.
*   **Backend:** There are no backend routes or models to support this feature.

### 2.5. Payments and Banking (Stripe Integration)

*   **Status:** **Not Implemented**.
*   **Frontend:** The UI components for managing payment methods and viewing transactions are **mockups** and do not contain any real functionality. The form for adding a bank account is a **non-functional prototype**.
*   **Backend:** The backend is set up to handle basic CRUD operations for bank accounts, but there is **no integration with Stripe or any other payment processor**.

## 3. Path to a True MVP: A Revised Roadmap

To get the LabLeap project to a state where it is ready for a true beta test, we must prioritize the completion of the core "Connect" workflow and the implementation of the most critical supporting features.

### Epic 1: Complete the Core "Connect" Workflow

*   **User Story: Implement the "Minimum Viable Profile" Gate**
    *   **Task:** Prevent a `Worker` from applying to a gig if their profile is incomplete.
    *   **Implementation:** Before triggering the `POST /api/gigs/:id/apply` API call in `GigDetailsPage.js`, check the `currentUser` object from the Redux store. If essential profile fields are empty, prevent the API call and display a modal or alert, redirecting the user to their profile page to complete it.

### Epic 2: Implement Core Provider and Offerings Functionality

*   **User Story: Complete the "Offerings" Frontend**
    *   **Task:** Remove all mock data from the "Offerings" pages and ensure that the UI is fully driven by the backend API.
    *   **Implementation:** Update the `Offerings.js` and `Offering.js` components to fetch all data from the API and to handle loading and error states gracefully.

### Epic 3: Prepare for Launch

*   **Task: Create a `TESTING_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md` Document**
    *   **Implementation:** Create a comprehensive guide for the final stages of testing and deployment, including a test plan, a bug triage process, and a deployment checklist.

## 4. Path to Deployment: A Strategic Overview

The project is not ready for a production deployment. The following steps outline a high-level path to get there *after* the MVP is complete.

1.  **Stabilize the MVP:**
    *   Complete the critical path features outlined above.
    *   Conduct thorough internal testing of the end-to-end user workflows.
    *   Refine the UI/UX based on internal feedback.

2.  **Prepare for Beta:**
    *   Set up a staging environment that mirrors the production architecture.
    *   Deploy the application to the staging environment for final testing.
    *   Recruit a small, closed group of beta testers.

3.  **Production Deployment:**
    *   Execute the production deployment plan.
    *   Onboard the first cohort of beta testers.
    *   Establish a system for collecting and prioritizing feedback.
