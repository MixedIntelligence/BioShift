# LabLeap: MVP Launch Plan

## 1. Celebrating Our Progress: The MVP is Complete!

We have successfully completed the core feature set for the LabLeap MVP. The "Connect" workflow is now fully functional, allowing scientists to apply for gigs and labs to accept them, with a two-way notification system to facilitate an off-platform connection.

This is a major milestone, and it is the direct result of a focused and disciplined effort to execute on the `TECHNICAL_REVIVAL_PLAN.md`.

### Key Accomplishments:

*   **Live Data Integration:** The frontend is now fully integrated with the backend API, replacing all mock data.
*   **Applicant Profile View:** Labs can now view the complete profiles of scientists who have applied to their gigs.
*   **Two-Way "Connect" Workflow:** The system now notifies both parties with contact information when an application is accepted, closing the loop and enabling a true connection.
*   **"Minimum Viable Profile" Gate:** A quality control gate has been implemented to ensure that only users with complete profiles can apply for gigs.

## 2. The Path to Launch: Next Steps

With the MVP now feature-complete, our focus shifts to the final stages of testing and deployment. The following steps will guide us to a successful beta launch.

### Step 1: Internal Testing & Stabilization

*   **Objective:** To conduct a thorough internal review of the end-to-end user workflow and identify and resolve any remaining bugs.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Create a dedicated test plan that covers all user stories in the MVP.
    *   Perform comprehensive testing of the "Connect" workflow, from gig creation to application acceptance.
    *   Identify and prioritize all bugs, with a focus on critical-path issues.
    *   Refine the UI/UX based on internal feedback to ensure a polished and intuitive user experience.

### Step 2: Prepare for Beta Launch

*   **Objective:** To set up a production-ready staging environment and prepare for the onboarding of our first beta testers.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Set up a staging environment that mirrors the production architecture (containerized Node.js backend, managed PostgreSQL database, and a CDN for the frontend).
    *   Deploy the stabilized application to the staging environment for final validation.
    *   Develop a beta tester recruitment plan and begin outreach to a small, closed group of labs and scientists.
    *   Prepare a simple onboarding guide for beta testers.

### Step 3: Production Deployment & Beta Launch

*   **Objective:** To deploy the application to production and officially launch the closed beta.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   Execute the production deployment plan.
    *   Onboard the first cohort of beta testers.
    *   Establish a system for collecting and prioritizing feedback from beta testers.
    *   Monitor the application for performance and stability.

By following this plan, we can move forward with confidence, knowing that we have a clear and actionable path to a successful launch.
