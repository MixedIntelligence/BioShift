# RBAC Fixes - July 5, 2025

## Issue Fixed
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) was not working correctly due to case mismatch between database role values and frontend role comparisons.

## Root Cause
- Database stores roles as: `'Lab'`, `'Worker'`, `'Provider'`, `'Admin'` (capitalized)
- Frontend code was comparing against: `'lab'`, `'worker'`, `'provider'`, `'admin'` (lowercase)
- This caused all role-based navigation and permissions to fail

## Files Modified

### Frontend Role Comparison Fixes
- `src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.js` - Fixed all role comparisons for navigation menu
- `src/pages/gigs/GigsListPage.js` - Fixed Lab/Worker specific buttons
- `src/pages/gigs/GigDetailsPage.js` - Fixed Lab/Worker role detection
- `src/pages/gigs/PostGigPage.js` - Fixed Lab-only access protection
- `src/pages/gigs/SuggestedPage.js` - Fixed all role-specific display logic
- `src/pages/offerings/Offerings.js` - Fixed access control (Labs/Workers can browse, Providers can manage)

### Component Cleanup
- Completely removed `src/components/RoleSwitcher.js` - Was causing infinite loops and not needed for production

## RBAC Now Working Correctly

### Lab Users Can See:
- ✅ "Post a Gig" in sidebar Gigs menu
- ✅ "My Gigs" in sidebar Gigs menu  
- ✅ "Browse Offerings" in sidebar Offerings menu
- ✅ "Create New Gig" button on gigs list page
- ✅ "View Applicants" button on gig cards

### Worker Users Can See:
- ✅ "My Applications" in sidebar Gigs menu
- ✅ "Browse Offerings" in sidebar Offerings menu
- ✅ "Apply Now" buttons on gig cards
- ✅ "Suggested Gigs" in sidebar

### Provider Users Can See:
- ✅ "My Offerings" in sidebar Offerings menu
- ✅ "Post an Offering" in sidebar Offerings menu
- ✅ "Suggested Labs" in sidebar

### Access Control Fixed:
- ✅ Only Labs can access `/app/post-gig`
- ✅ Labs, Workers, and Providers can access `/app/offerings`
- ✅ Role-specific UI elements show/hide correctly

## Testing
- Backend confirmed working with Lab user `lab69@lab69.com` / `lab69@lab69.com`
- Frontend/Backend servers running on ports 3000/8080
- Infinite loop errors resolved by removing RoleSwitcher component

## Next Steps
Users should now be able to:
1. Login as any role and see correct navigation menus
2. Access role-appropriate functionality
3. Use the gig posting/application workflow
4. Browse offerings based on their role
