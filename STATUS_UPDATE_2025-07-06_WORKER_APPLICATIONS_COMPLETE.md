# STATUS UPDATE - July 6, 2025 - Worker Applications Feature Complete

## üéØ MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT: Complete Worker Applications System

### Overview
Successfully implemented and tested the complete **"My Applications"** feature for Workers, addressing one of the key user stories from the project roadmap. This feature allows Workers to view and track all gigs they've applied to in one centralized location.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TODAY

### Backend Implementation
1. **API Endpoint**: Added `/api/users/me/applications` route in `backend/routes/users.js`
2. **Route Fix**: Resolved Express.js route ordering issue where `/me/applications` was being caught by `/:id/applications`
3. **Model Integration**: Properly integrated `listUserApplications` function from gig model
4. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling and response formatting
5. **Authentication**: Ensured proper JWT authentication and user authorization

### Frontend Implementation
1. **Component Creation**: Built `src/pages/applications/MyApplications.js` with complete UI
2. **API Integration**: Fixed import structure to work with default export pattern in api.js
3. **Styling**: Created professional SCSS styling in `MyApplications.module.scss`
4. **Navigation**: Confirmed "My Applications" link exists in Worker sidebar
5. **Data Display**: Implemented comprehensive application history display with:
   - Application status badges (pending, accepted, rejected)
   - Application dates and timestamps
   - Gig details (title, description, location, pay rate, duration)
   - Lab information for each application

### Testing & Verification
1. **End-to-End Testing**: Created and ran comprehensive test scripts
2. **Backend Verification**: Tested API endpoints with real user data
3. **Application Flow**: Verified complete worker application workflow
4. **Data Integrity**: Confirmed proper data retrieval and display
5. **Error Scenarios**: Tested error handling and edge cases
