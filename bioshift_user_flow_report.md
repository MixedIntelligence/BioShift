# BioShift User Flow Test Report - 2025-07-07

## 1. Objective
The primary objective of this test was to validate the user registration and login flows on the `bioshift.xyz` web application using the Puppeteer MCP tool.

## 2. Summary of Findings
The user flow test was **unsuccessful** due to persistent application instability. While I was able to successfully register a new user, subsequent attempts to log in and interact with the application failed repeatedly. The application frequently entered an unresponsive state, with the page content disappearing, preventing any further actions.

This indicates a critical client-side issue that needs to be addressed before the user flow can be properly tested.

## 3. Detailed Steps and Observations

### 3.1. Initial Navigation and Registration
*   **Action:** Navigated to `https://bioshift.xyz`.
*   **Observation:** The landing page loaded successfully.
*   **Action:** Clicked the "Get Started" button to navigate to the registration page.
*   **Observation:** Successfully navigated to the registration page.
*   **Action:** Filled out the registration form with the following details:
    *   **Account Type:** Scientist/Worker
    *   **Email:** `testuser@bioshift.xyz`
    *   **Password:** `password123`
*   **Action:** Clicked the "Create Account" button.
*   **Observation:** The registration process completed successfully.

### 3.2. Login Attempts and Failures
*   **Action:** Navigated to the login page at `https://bioshift.xyz/#/login`.
*   **Observation:** The login page initially loaded.
*   **Action:** Attempted to fill the email field with `testuser@bioshift.xyz`.
*   **Result:** **Failed.** The page became unresponsive, and the HTML body was empty, indicating a client-side crash.

### 3.3. Subsequent Failures
*   All subsequent attempts to navigate to the login or registration pages resulted in the same failure. The application would load momentarily and then crash, leaving a blank page.

## 4. Analysis of Potential Causes
The consistent failure of the application after the initial registration suggests a critical issue with the client-side code. The most likely causes are:

1.  **JavaScript Error on Render:** A JavaScript error is likely occurring during the rendering of the login and registration pages, causing the application to crash. This could be related to how the application handles user state after registration.
2.  **State Management Issues:** The application's state management might be entering an invalid state after registration, leading to a failure to render subsequent pages.
3.  **Race Condition:** There may be a race condition where the application attempts to access resources or data that are not yet available, causing a fatal error.

## 5. Recommendations
Given the severity of the issue, I recommend the following actions:

1.  **Investigate Client-Side Logs:** The development team should inspect the browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors that occur after navigating to the login or registration pages.
2.  **Review State Management:** The application's state management logic should be reviewed to ensure it correctly handles the user's state after registration.
3.  **Add Robust Error Handling:** Implementing more robust error handling on the client side could help prevent the application from crashing and provide more informative error messages.

Until these issues are resolved, it is not possible to complete a full user flow test of the `bioshift.xyz` application.
