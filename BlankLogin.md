# Blank Screen on Login: Diagnostic Report

## 1. Summary of the Problem

Users are reporting a blank white screen immediately after logging into the BioShift platform at `bioshift.xyz`. The expected behavior is a redirect to the `/gigs` page, but instead, the application appears to crash, leaving the user with an unusable interface.

## 2. Diagnostic Steps Performed

The following steps were taken to diagnose the root cause of the issue:

### Step 1: Initial Navigation and Login Attempt

*   **Action:** Navigated to `https://bioshift.xyz/login` to simulate a user login.
*   **Result:** The page was unresponsive and failed to load the login form. A screenshot revealed that the landing page was being rendered instead of the login page.
*   **Analysis:** The application uses hash-based routing (`#/login`), but the initial navigation was to a non-hash URL. The server correctly served the `index.html` file, but the client-side router did not render the correct component.

### Step 2: Corrected Navigation to Login Page

*   **Action:** Navigated to the correct URL, `https://bioshift.xyz/#/login`.
*   **Result:** The login page rendered correctly, displaying the email and password fields as expected.

### Step 3: User Authentication

*   **Action:** Entered the test user credentials (`edge@test.com`) and clicked the login button.
*   **Result:** The login was successful, and the page redirected. However, the post-login screen was completely blank, confirming the user's report.

### Step 4: Console Log Analysis

*   **Action:** Inspected the browser's console logs immediately after the failed redirect.
*   **Result:** The logs revealed a critical sequence of events:
    1.  **Login Success:** The application successfully authenticated the user and stored a token in `localStorage`.
    2.  **User Data Fetch:** Upon re-initialization, the application detected the token and attempted to fetch user data by calling the `findMe()` API endpoint.
    3.  **Critical Error:** A fatal, unhandled JavaScript error occurred during the `findMe()` API call, logged as `[error] JSHandle@error`.
    4.  **Render Failure:** This error immediately crashed the React application, preventing any components from rendering and leaving the root DOM element (`<div id="root"></div>`) empty.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis

The blank screen is caused by an **unhandled exception in the `findMe()` API call** within the authentication logic.

When a user logs in, the application calls the `/api/auth/me` endpoint to retrieve their profile information. For the test user `edge@test.com`, this endpoint is either returning an unexpected error (e.g., a 500 Internal Server Error) or a data payload that the frontend code cannot correctly parse. This unhandled error corrupts the application's state and halts the rendering process, resulting in a blank page.

The problem is not with the post-login redirect itself, but with the failure of the application to handle a critical API error gracefully during the user initialization process.

## 4. Recommended Next Steps

To resolve this issue, the following actions are recommended:

1.  **Inspect `src/actions/auth.js`:** This file likely contains the `findMe()` API call. The code should be examined to understand how the response is handled.
2.  **Add Robust Error Handling:** Implement a `try...catch` block around the `findMe()` API call to catch any exceptions.
3.  **Implement Detailed Logging:** Inside the `catch` block, add detailed logging to capture the specific error message, status code, and response body from the failed API call. This will provide the necessary information to fix the backend issue or adjust the frontend parsing logic.
4.  **Provide a Fallback:** If the `findMe()` call fails, the application should gracefully log the user out and redirect them to the login page with an appropriate error message (e.g., "Session has expired, please log in again."). This will prevent the application from crashing and provide a better user experience.
