# BioShift (BioMVP) Blank Page Issue, Design Stripdown, and Restoration Plan

## 1. Background & Problem Statement

The BioShift (BioMVP) platform experienced a persistent blank page and infinite redirect after user login. This critical issue blocked access to the main dashboard and all authenticated routes, severely impacting usability and testing. To facilitate debugging, the UI/UX design was temporarily stripped down, removing custom styles, layouts, and non-essential components to isolate the root cause.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis: Blank Page & Infinite Redirect

### 2.1. Observed Symptoms
- After login, users encountered a blank page or were stuck in an infinite redirect loop.
- The dashboard and all authenticated routes were inaccessible.

### 2.2. Technical Diagnosis
- The Redux `currentUser` state was not being set or read correctly after login or page refresh.
- The `isAuthenticated` flag in Redux was not reliably updated, causing route guards (e.g., `UserRoute`) to misinterpret authentication state.
- The `UserRoute` component was referencing `window.store` directly, bypassing Redux props and causing race conditions.
- The app attempted to render protected routes before authentication state was initialized, leading to infinite redirects or blank screens.

## 3. Fix Implementation: Step-by-Step

### 3.1. Redux Auth Flow Refactor
- Ensured `currentUser` and `isAuthenticated` are set immediately after login and on page refresh.
- Centralized Redux state updates to avoid multiple sources of truth.
- Updated reducers and actions to guarantee consistent state.

### 3.2. Route Guard (`UserRoute`) Refactor
- Refactored `UserRoute` to use Redux state from props, not `window.store`.
- Added a `loadingInit` guard to block route rendering until authentication state is initialized.
- Prevented infinite redirect loops by only redirecting when `isAuthenticated` is definitively `false`.

### 3.3. Routing & Error Handling
- Updated `App.js`, `UserRoute`, and `LayoutComponent` to use the improved Redux state.
- Restored all real dashboard routes in `Layout.js` (e.g., `/app/gigs`, `/app/offerings`).
- Removed test/fake routes and ensured only valid routes are present.

### 3.4. Global Styles & UI Restoration (Partial)
- Restored global style imports for Bootstrap and app SCSS in `src/index.js`.
- Confirmed that login now routes to `/app/gigs` with no infinite loop or blank page.

## 4. Why the Design Was Stripped Down
- The design (custom SCSS, layout, sidebar, header, etc.) was temporarily removed to:
  - Eliminate confounding variables during debugging.
  - Isolate the authentication and routing logic.
  - Ensure the blank page issue was not caused by a style or layout bug.
- This allowed for rapid iteration and clear identification of the root cause.

## 5. Design Restoration & Future-Proofing Plan

### 5.1. Reference Repo for Correct Design
- The live GitHub repo (BioShiftv9 branch) at https://github.com/MixedIntelligence/BioShift/tree/BioShiftv9 is the authoritative source for the correct UI/UX.
- The reference repo was cloned to `reference-git/` for direct file comparison.

### 5.2. Restoration Steps
1. **Compare Layout & Components:**
   - Analyze `Layout.js`, `Sidebar`, `Header`, and `Helper` components in both current and reference repos.
   - Identify any missing or altered design elements (structure, imports, logic).
2. **Restore Global Styles:**
   - Ensure all global SCSS, Bootstrap, and theme variables are imported as in the reference.
   - Restore any missing or altered style files (`app.scss`, `_variables.scss`, etc.).
3. **Component-Level Restoration:**
   - Restore the correct structure and props for `Sidebar`, `Header`, and other layout components.
   - Ensure all dashboard and profile routes are present and match the reference.
4. **UI/UX Parity:**
   - Check for missing fonts, colors, spacing, sidebar/header structure, and other visual elements.
   - Restore any removed or altered JSX/HTML structure.
5. **Testing:**
   - After each restoration step, test login and navigation to ensure the blank page/infinite redirect does not return.
   - Use Redux DevTools and browser console to verify state and error-free operation.
6. **Cleanup:**
   - Remove any temporary debug code, fallback error routes, or stripped-down placeholders.
   - Clean up console warnings and missing asset errors as needed.

### 5.3. Ensuring the Issue Does Not Return
- **Single Source of Truth:** All authentication and user state must flow through Redux, with no direct DOM or window references.
- **Initialization Guard:** Always block protected route rendering until authentication state is initialized (`loadingInit` or similar guard).
- **Component Parity:** Only restore design elements that do not interfere with the improved auth flow and Redux logic.
- **Regression Testing:** After each design restoration, test login, logout, and route navigation.
- **Documentation:** Keep this document updated with any new findings or changes.
