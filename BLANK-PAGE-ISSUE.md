# Blank Page Problem - Investigation & Remediation Log

## Overview
The BioShift (BioMVP) platform has been experiencing a critical blank page issue after user login, which blocks all further development and testing. This document details the symptoms, root causes, attempted fixes, and the current state of the investigation. Resolving this is the top project priority.

---

## Problem Description
- **Symptom:** After a user logs in, the app displays a blank page instead of routing to the main dashboard or protected content.
- **Impact:** All authenticated user flows are blocked. No development or QA can proceed until this is fixed.
- **Scope:** Affects all users and all environments where the bug is present.

## Investigation Timeline & Actions

### 1. Initial Diagnosis
- Confirmed the backend and database were not the cause (registration and browsing worked, login did not).
- Stripped down `App.js` to a minimal React component and gradually reintroduced routing, Redux, and layout logic.
- Verified that with only plain routes and components, the app rendered correctly (no blank page).
- The blank page returned when using custom route components (`UserRoute`) and when authentication state was not set.

### 2. Authentication State Debugging
- Inspected Redux state and found that `currentUser` was not set after login, causing `UserRoute` to always redirect to `/login` (which was also blank).
- Updated `receiveToken` in `auth.js` to immediately dispatch `AUTH_INIT_SUCCESS` with `currentUser` after login.
- Added debug routes and plain test routes to confirm routing and rendering work in isolation.
- Confirmed that all public routes (`/login`, `/register`, `/debug`) render correctly with inline components, but are blank with the original components.

### 3. Component & Route Inspection
- Inspected and confirmed the structure and exports of `Login` and `Register` components.
- Verified that Redux `currentUser` is now set after login, and that protected routes are accessible if authentication state is correct.
- Restored real routes for `LandingPage`, `Login`, and `Register` in `App.js`.

### 4. Environment & Backend Fixes
- Fixed frontend API URL to point to the correct backend port (5000 instead of 8080).
- Set up a local Postgres database, imported schema/data from Railway, and configured the backend `.env` with a working JWT secret and connection string.
- Restarted backend and frontend to ensure all environment changes took effect.

---

## Current State
- The blank page issue is directly tied to authentication state and Redux store population.
- With the correct Redux state (`currentUser` set), the app routes and renders as expected.
- If authentication fails or Redux is not populated, the app falls back to a blank page due to route guards and redirects.

---

## Remaining Issues & Next Steps
- **Ensure Redux `currentUser` is always set after login and on page refresh.**
- **Audit all custom route components (`UserRoute`, `AdminRoute`, etc.) for correct logic and error handling.**
- **Add robust error boundaries and fallback UI for all routes.**
- **Continue to test login, register, and protected routes with real backend and database.**
- **Monitor for any regressions or new blank page triggers.**

---

## Priority Action Plan
1. **Test login flow with valid credentials and confirm Redux state.**
2. **If blank page appears, check Redux devtools and browser console for errors.**
3. **Add logging to all route guards and authentication logic.**
4. **Ensure backend returns correct user data and token on login.**
5. **If Redux is not populated, trace the flow from backend response to Redux action dispatch.**
6. **Do not proceed with new feature development until this is 100% resolved.**

---

## Summary
The blank page problem is a critical blocker. All investigation points to authentication state and Redux population as the root cause. The team must focus on ensuring the login flow, Redux state, and route guards are robust and error-tolerant. No further development should proceed until this is fixed.
