## 1. Current Status
The project is currently in a **pre-beta** stage. The core "Connect" workflow is feature-complete, but a critical bug is preventing user registration and login.

## 2. Key Issues
- **Authentication Failure:** Users are unable to register or log in.
- **Silent Backend Failure:** The registration process fails silently on the backend, and no new users are created in the database.
- **"Invalid credentials" Error:** Users are receiving an "Invalid credentials" error when attempting to log in, even after a seemingly successful registration.

## 3. Debugging Summary
- Corrected a `username` vs. `email` inconsistency in the database schema and backend models.
- Identified and corrected a routing issue related to the use of `HashRouter`.
- Added extensive logging to the `register` route in `backend/routes/auth.js` to trace the execution flow.
- Corrected the `createUser` function in `backend/models/user.js` to use the correct method for retrieving the new user's ID.

## 4. Next Steps
- The immediate next step is to analyze the logs from the `register` route to identify the root cause of the silent backend failure.
- Once the root cause is identified, I will implement a fix to ensure that new users are correctly created in the database.
- After the fix is implemented, I will re-run the end-to-end test script to validate the complete registration and login workflow.
