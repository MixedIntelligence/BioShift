# LabLeap V10 - Product Definition & Roadmap (PDR)

**Date:** July 11, 2025
**Author:** Fractional CTO

## 1. Overview & Goal

The primary goal is to transition the LabLeap platform from its current Alpha state to a stable, reliable platform ready for a public beta launch. This involves a phased approach focusing first on stabilizing the existing feature set, then implementing critical new functionality like payments.

## 2. Current Status (Alpha)

*   **Deployed:** The application is live on Vercel and Railway, a significant achievement.
*   **Feature Complete (at a high level):** Core modules like the Gigs Marketplace, Provider Offerings, and User Management are implemented.
*   **Requires Stabilization:** As outlined in `v10-Roadmap.md`, these core features require auditing, bug fixing, and refinement to ensure they are robust and user-friendly.

## 3. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Alpha Stabilization (Immediate Priority)
This phase focuses on ensuring the core product is flawless. We cannot invite a large number of beta testers until the existing experience is seamless.

*   **Action Items:**
    1.  **Gigs Marketplace Audit:** Conduct end-to-end testing of all user flows: posting, browsing, applying, and acceptance.
    2.  **Providers & Offerings Polish:** Verify and fix all role-based access control (RBAC) issues. Ensure data integrity between providers and their offerings.
    3.  **Messaging & Chat Validation:** Test real-time chat functionality for all user roles and implement missing notification features.
    4.  **Document Management Security:** Finalize and secure the document upload/viewing features.

### Phase 2: New Feature Integration (Post-Stabilization)
Once the core is stable, we will implement features critical for the business.

*   **Action Items:**
    1.  **Stripe Payments Integration:** Implement Stripe for gig payments and offering purchases. This is the highest priority new feature.
    2.  **CI/CD & Automated Testing:** Develop an automated testing suite to run in our CI/CD pipeline. This is crucial for maintaining quality as we scale.

### Phase 3: Future Enhancements (Post-Beta)
These are advanced features that will follow a successful beta launch.

*   **Action Items:**
    1.  **AI Document Parsing:** Begin R&D for parsing skills and credentials from uploaded documents.
    2.  **Bionics & NANDA Integrations:** Define API contracts and plan for these strategic integrations.

## 4. Testing Strategy

*   **Alpha Testing (Current):** Continue testing with the internal team and a handful of trusted, early-adopter users.
*   **Beta Testing (Post-Phase 1):** Launch a public beta program to gather wider feedback once the platform is stable.
*   **Feedback Mechanism:** A structured system for bug reports and feature requests from all testers is required.
