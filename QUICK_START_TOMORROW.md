# Quick Start Guide for Tomorrow (July 6, 2025)

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED**

### 1. Test Frontend-Backend Connection
The main issue blocking Gigs functionality has been fixed but needs verification:

```bash
# 1. Restart the frontend to pick up API configuration changes
cd C:\Users\Chad-Main\Desktop\BioMVP\v9
npm start

# 2. Test the gigs page
# Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/app/gigs
# Should show 3 sample gigs instead of 404 error
```

### 2. If Gigs Page Works ✅
- Test user flow: Register → Skip Onboarding → Browse Gigs
- Test gig details page functionality
- Test search functionality

### 3. If Still Getting 404 ❌
Alternative fix options:
- Check if proxy configuration in package.json is working
- Verify both servers are running (frontend:3000, backend:8080)
- Check browser network tab to see actual API calls being made

## 📁 **KEY FILES MODIFIED TODAY**

### Frontend Changes
- `src/services/api.js` - Updated to use correct backend URL
- `src/pages/auth/onboarding/Onboarding.js` - Added skip button and fixed skills API
- `src/pages/gigs/GigsListPage.js` - Updated to handle real data structure
- `package.json` - Added proxy configuration

### Backend Changes  
- `backend/routes/profile.js` - Fixed education API response
- `backend/models/user.js` - Enhanced education function return values

### Sample Data Created
- 3 test gigs are in the database and available via API

## 🎯 **EXPECTED OUTCOME**

After frontend restart, the complete user journey should work:
1. **Register** new user ✅
2. **Skip onboarding** with new button ✅  
3. **Browse gigs** on `/app/gigs` page 🔄 (needs testing)
4. **View gig details** by clicking "View Details" 🔄 (needs testing)

## 📞 **IF YOU NEED HELP**

The most likely issue is the API connection. Check:
1. Both servers running (npm run dev in backend, npm start in root)
2. Browser console for API call URLs (should be localhost:8080, not 3000)
3. Network tab in dev tools to see actual requests

Everything else is working and tested via PowerShell API calls.
