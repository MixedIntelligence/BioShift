# LabLeap v9 MVP Handoff

**Project:** LabLeap v9 MVP Revival
**Date:** July 5, 2025
**Author:** Roo, Senior Fullstack Engineer & Fractional CTO
**Status:** Phase 1 (MVP Stabilization) is complete. The core authentication and registration systems have been successfully refactored and stabilized. The application is now in a solid state for Phase 2 (Beta Feature Implementation) to begin.

## 1. Summary of Work Completed

The primary objective was to revive a broken MVP for a closed beta launch. The project was executed in two main stages:

### Stage 1: Initial MVP Stabilization

*   **Problem:** The initial MVP was non-functional, with critical bugs preventing user registration and causing profile page instability.
*   **Analysis:** The root cause was identified as a faulty JWT authentication flow, where the backend and frontend were misaligned on user identifiers (`username` vs. `email`).
*   **Fixes:**
    *   Resolved the immediate JWT authentication bugs.
    *   Stabilized the user profile page.

### Stage 2: Core Feature Implementation & Auth System Overhaul

Following stabilization, we implemented foundational features and performed a complete refactor of the authentication system.

*   **New Features:**
    *   **"Post a Gig":** Implemented the workflow for Lab users to create new gig postings.
    *   **"Provider Offerings":** Built the functionality for Provider users to create and manage service offerings, reusing existing e-commerce components on the frontend.

*   **Auth System Refactor:**
    *   **Problem:** The original system lacked role selection at registration and was built on a fragile `username`-based system.
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  **New User Flow:** Implemented a central landing page ([`src/pages/landing/Landing.js`](src/pages/landing/Landing.js:1)) that directs users to role-specific registration pages (`/register/:role`).
        2.  **Database & Backend Migration:** Migrated the `users` table and all corresponding backend models and routes ([`backend/routes/auth.js`](backend/routes/auth.js:1)) to use `email` as the primary unique identifier.
        3.  **Frontend Refactor:** Updated the entire frontend authentication flow ([`src/actions/auth.js`](src/actions/auth.js:1), [`src/pages/login/Login.js`](src/pages/login/Login.js:1), [`src/pages/register/Register.js`](src/pages/register/Register.js:1)) to align with the new email-based system and to handle role-based registration.
        4.  **API Endpoint Correction:** Fixed a critical bug where the frontend was making requests to a duplicated API path (`/api/api/...`).

## 2. Current Application State

*   **Stack:** Node.js (Express) backend, React frontend, Redux for state management, and SQLite for the database.
*   **Authentication:** The system now uses a robust, email-based JWT authentication flow.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **User Registration:** Users can successfully register for "Lab", "Worker", or "Provider" roles.
    *   **User Login:** Authenticates users and provides access to the application.
    *   **Gig Posting:** Labs can post new gigs.
    *   **Provider Offerings:** Providers can create and list their service offerings.
*   **Test Credentials:** All necessary credentials for testing are located in [`SEED_CREDENTIALS.md`](SEED_CREDENTIALS.md:1).

## 3. Next Steps & Recommendations

The application is now stable and ready for the implementation of the remaining beta features.

### Immediate Tasks (from `BETA_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`):

1.  **"Connect" Workflow:** Build out the core functionality that allows Labs, Workers, and Providers to connect with each other.
2.  **Document Management:** Implement the system for users to upload and manage documents on their profiles.
3.  **Notification System:** Create the in-app notification system to alert users of relevant activity.

### Recommendations:

*   **Code Cleanup:** The `Login.js` component contains several unused imports that are generating linter warnings. These should be removed to improve code hygiene.
*   **Continue with Beta Plan:** Proceed with the feature development outlined in the `BETA_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
