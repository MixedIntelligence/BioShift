# LabLeap v9 MVP Revival - Handoff Document (July 4, 6:00 AM)

## 1. Current Status

**Objective:** To revive the LabLeap v9 MVP for a closed beta test.

**Working:**
*   The backend server is fully functional and starts without errors.
*   The database is seeded with test data.
*   All backend API endpoints have been implemented and tested individually.

**Broken:**
*   The frontend application fails to compile due to multiple errors, preventing any testing or use of the application.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue is a series of compilation errors in the frontend React application. These errors were initially masked by a misconfigured startup process that was attempting to run the frontend and backend as a single application. After correcting the startup process, the frontend compilation errors became apparent.

The errors fall into three categories:
1.  **Incorrect Import Paths:** Multiple components are attempting to import modules from outside the `src` directory, which is not allowed by Create React App.
2.  **Missing or Incorrect Exports:** Components are trying to import functions and components that are not correctly exported from their respective modules.
3.  **Syntax Errors:** There are syntax errors in several component files that are preventing them from being parsed correctly by Babel.

## 3. Action Plan

To resolve these issues, I will take the following steps, one at a time, to ensure each fix is applied correctly before moving to the next:

1.  **Fix `GigsListPage.js`:**
    *   Replace the obsolete `InputGroupAddon` component with `InputGroupText`.
2.  **Fix `Profile.js`:**
    *   Correct the misplaced `export` statement.
3.  **Fix `Publications.js`:**
    *   Correct the import path for the `api` service.
    *   Correct the usage of the `api` service methods to use the default export.
4.  **Fix `Education.js`:**
    *   Correct the usage of the `api` service methods to use the default export.
5.  **Fix `Skills.js`:**
    *   Correct the usage of the `api` service methods to use the default export.
6.  **Fix `Login.js`:**
    *   Add the missing import for the `loginUser` action.

Once all of these issues have been resolved, the frontend application should compile successfully, and we can proceed with end-to-end testing.
