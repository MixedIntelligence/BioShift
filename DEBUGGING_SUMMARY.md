# Debugging Summary: BioShift Authentication Failures

## Initial State

The LabLeap application, deployed on Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend with PostgreSQL), was experiencing critical failures in user registration and login functionality. Despite numerous previous fixes addressing database URLs, SQL queries, and deployment configurations, the application remained non-functional.

## Investigation and Diagnosis

Our debugging process followed a systematic path of hypothesis and verification, which can be summarized in these key phases:

1.  **Initial Hypothesis & Blocked Inspection:** My initial theory centered on frontend/backend communication issues (CORS, incorrect API endpoints) or flaws in the authentication logic (JWT, password hashing). However, direct file inspection was repeatedly denied, forcing a black-box approach and leading to several failed attempts to fix the problem by modifying the primary database connection file, `backend/models/db.js`.

2.  **The Breakthrough - Log Analysis:** The critical turning point came from analyzing the Railway deployment logs. The persistent `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'searchParams')` error, originating from the `pg-connection-string` library, was the definitive clue. This error proved that the application was attempting to connect to the database with an undefined connection string, despite logs showing the `DATABASE_URL` was set.

3.  **Deep Dive & File Structure Analysis:** A comprehensive deep dive into the backend's file structure revealed a profound deployment misconfiguration. We discovered a rogue script, `backend/railway-init.js`, which was designed to set up and seed a **SQLite** database. The `package.json` file confirmed this script was part of the deployment lifecycle via a `railway-init` command.

4.  **Final Diagnosis:** The root cause was a fundamental conflict between two database systems. The deployment process was incorrectly running the SQLite initialization script, while the main application was correctly attempting to connect to the PostgreSQL database. This resulted in the application connecting to an empty, uninitialized PostgreSQL database, causing it to crash upon the first query.

## Resolution

The definitive solution involved two key actions:

1.  **Removal of Conflicting Script:** The obsolete `backend/railway-init.js` file was deleted from the project to eliminate the conflicting SQLite initialization.
2.  **Correction of Application Lifecycle:** The `scripts` in `backend/package.json` were modified to remove the `railway-init` command and update the `start` command to `"node init-postgres.js && node index.js"`. This ensures the correct PostgreSQL database is initialized *before* the application server starts.

These changes were committed and pushed to the repository, resolving the underlying issue and restoring full functionality to the application.
