# BioShift Blank Page Issue: Summary & Next Steps

## Conversation Summary

- **Problem:** The BioShift (BioMVP) platform had a persistent blank page and infinite redirect after login, blocking access to the dashboard and authenticated routes.
- **Debugging Approach:** The UI/UX design was stripped down to isolate the root cause, focusing on Redux authentication and routing logic.
- **Diagnosis:**
  - Redux `currentUser` and `isAuthenticated` were not reliably set/read after login or refresh.
  - Route guards (`UserRoute`) referenced `window.store` and did not wait for auth state initialization, causing race conditions and infinite redirects.
- **Fixes Implemented:**
  - Refactored Redux auth flow to ensure `currentUser` and `isAuthenticated` are always set after login and refresh.
  - Updated `UserRoute` to use Redux props and block redirects until auth state is initialized.
  - Restored all real dashboard routes and global style imports.
  - Confirmed login now routes to `/app/gigs` with no blank page or infinite loop.
- **Design Restoration Plan:**
  - Cloned the reference repo (BioShiftv9 branch) for authoritative UI/UX.
  - Began comparing `Layout.js` and related files to identify missing/altered design elements.

## Next Steps

1. **Component Comparison:**
   - Compare `Sidebar`, `Header`, and `Helper` components in your workspace and the reference repo.
   - Identify and restore any missing or altered structure, props, or logic.
2. **Global & Component Styles:**
   - Ensure all global SCSS, Bootstrap, and theme variables are imported and match the reference.
   - Restore any missing or altered style files.
3. **UI/UX Parity:**
   - Restore fonts, colors, spacing, sidebar/header structure, and other visual elements to match the reference.
   - Remove any debug code or fallback error routes.
4. **Testing:**
   - After each restoration step, test login and navigation to ensure the blank page/infinite redirect does not return.
   - Use Redux DevTools and browser console to verify state and error-free operation.
5. **Documentation & Cleanup:**
   - Update documentation with any new findings or changes.
   - C:\Users\Chad-Main\Desktop\BioMVP\v9\BLANK-PAGE-ISSUE-RESTORATION-PLAN.md is our current plan
   - Clean up console warnings and missing asset errors as needed.

**You are now ready to proceed with design restoration and ensure platform stability.**
