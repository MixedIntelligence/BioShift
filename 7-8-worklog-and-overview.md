# 2025-07-08 Worklog & Overview

## Summary (â‰ˆ250 words)

Today, we focused on productionizing and stabilizing the BioShift/LabLeap MVP, with a particular emphasis on backend compatibility, frontend robustness, and seamless user experience. The main objective was to ensure the platform runs exclusively on PostgreSQL, eliminating all legacy SQLite dependencies, and to address critical frontend issues that led to blank pages and chart errors for new or edge-case users.

Key backend improvements included refactoring all database utility and seed scripts to use the `pg` library and `DATABASE_URL`, updating documentation to clarify Postgres-only support, and removing all SQLite files and references. The `/api/gigs/my-gigs` endpoint was diagnosed and fixed: the route was updated to use async PostgreSQL queries, resolving the 500 error and ensuring new gigs are correctly associated and displayed for users.

On the frontend, we added robust null/undefined checks for user and token handling in the main app, router, and dashboard. Rickshaw chart components were refactored to use proper React state management and defensive error handling, preventing crashes and blank pages when data is missing or malformed. These changes were committed and pushed to git, and deployment guidance was provided for both Railway (backend) and Vercel (frontend).

Overall, the platform is now more stable, user-friendly, and ready for further demo or production use. Remaining issues can be addressed with similar defensive coding and deployment best practices.
