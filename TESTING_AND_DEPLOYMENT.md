# LabLeap: Testing and Deployment Guide

## 1. Overview

This document provides a detailed guide for the final stages of testing and deployment for the LabLeap MVP. With the core feature set now complete, our focus shifts to ensuring a stable, high-quality release.

## 2. Internal Testing & Stabilization

### 2.1. Objective

To conduct a thorough internal review of the end-to-end user workflow, identify and resolve any remaining bugs, and refine the UI/UX to ensure a polished and intuitive user experience.

### 2.2. Test Plan

A comprehensive test plan should be created to cover all user stories in the MVP. The following areas are critical:

*   **The "Connect" Workflow:**
    *   Verify that a `Worker` can successfully apply for a gig.
    *   Verify that a `Lab` can view all applicants for a gig.
    *   Verify that a `Lab` can click on an applicant's name to view their full public profile.
    *   Verify that when a `Lab` accepts an application, both the `Lab` and the `Worker` receive a notification with each other's contact information.
*   **The "Minimum Viable Profile" Gate:**
    *   Verify that a `Worker` with an incomplete profile (missing a headline or bio) is prevented from applying for a gig.
    *   Verify that the user is clearly informed why their application was blocked and is redirected to their profile page to complete it.
*   **User Authentication:**
    *   Verify that users can register, log in, and log out successfully.
    *   Verify that the application maintains the user's session state correctly.
*   **Role-Based Access Control:**
    *   Verify that users are restricted to the actions and views appropriate for their role (`Lab`, `Worker`, `Provider`).

### 2.3. Bug Triage and Resolution

All identified bugs should be triaged and prioritized based on their severity and impact on the user experience. A bug tracking system (e.g., GitHub Issues) should be used to manage this process.

## 3. Beta Launch Preparation

### 3.1. Staging Environment

A staging environment that mirrors the production architecture should be set up for final testing. This environment should include:

*   A containerized deployment of the Node.js backend.
*   A managed PostgreSQL database.
*   A CDN for serving the static frontend assets.

### 3.2. Beta Tester Onboarding

*   A small, closed group of beta testers (both labs and scientists) should be recruited.
*   A simple onboarding guide should be created to help beta testers get started with the application.
*   A clear process for collecting and prioritizing feedback from beta testers should be established.

## 4. Production Deployment

### 4.1. Deployment Checklist

*   [ ] The application has been successfully deployed to the staging environment.
*   [ ] All critical bugs have been resolved.
*   [ ] The production database has been provisioned and configured.
*   [ ] The production environment has been configured with all necessary environment variables.
*   [ ] A final, comprehensive round of testing has been completed on the staging environment.

### 4.2. Launch

Once all items on the deployment checklist have been completed, the application can be deployed to production and the closed beta can officially begin.
